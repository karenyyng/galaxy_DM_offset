	 initial aperture centroid = weighted mean galaxy location in each spatial dimension\\

\section{Statistical aspect of representing the distribution of offsets}

Another statistical aspect that needs attention for computing the
significance level is the interpretation of the 
projections. 
We interpret the projections as the possible ways for observing 
cluster of the Illustris simulation. 
However, we also need to preserve the mass abundance of clusters, i.e. number
of clusters in a certain cluster mass range. 
When we try to draw conclusions from the full sample of the clusters with all
the projections, the mass abundance is consistent with the original simulation. 
However, when we subset the samples, the mass abundance will deviate.  

If we assume the chosen projection of each cluster 
to have negligible dependence of the projection of another cluster, the ways to
choose all the projections proceed as follows:
For each of the 43 clusters, there are 768 projections to draw from, 
giving $768^{43}$ combinations of possible observations of the 
Illustris simulation, which is a daunting number. In fact, the number of
possible observations is daunting even
if we reduce the number of projections per cluster to only 12, giving $12^{43}$
possible observations. 
We therefore pick a few special cases to discuss while keeping in mind that  
the mass abundance should be preserved.
