\section{Default weights used for Dawson's Monte Carlo simulation}
\label{app:priors}
The default weight that we employed can be summarized as
follows for most of the output variables: 
\begin{equation}
	w(v_{3D}(t_{\rm per})) = 0\text{ if }v_{3D}(t_{\rm per}) >
	v_{\text{free fall}}. 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	w(TSP_{\rm out}) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSP_{\rm out} < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In addition, we apply the following weight on $TSP_{\rm ret}$:
\begin{equation}
	w(TSP_{\rm ret}) = 
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if }TSP_{\rm ret} < \text{age of universe at } z=0.87	\\
		& 0~\text{otherwise} \label{eqn:TSM_1}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
To correct for observational limitations, we further convolved the
posterior probabilities of the different realizations with 
\begin{equation}
	w(TSP_{\rm out} | T) = 2 \frac{TSP_{\rm out}}{T},
\end{equation}
to account for how the subclusters move faster at lower $TSP$ and thus it
is more probable to observe the subclusters at a stage with a larger $TSP$.

\section{Plots of outputs of the Monte Carlo simulation}
We present the PDFs of the inputs of the dynamical simulation and the
marginalized PDFs of the outputs after applying the polarization weight in
addition to the default weights. See Fig.~\ref{fig:plot_config} for explanations of
the order that we present the figures containing the PDFs .

\section{Comparison of the outgoing and returning scenario}
\label{app:Bayes_factor}
Here, we compare the different merger scenarios using the two relics
independently and show that they consistently give the conclusion that the returning
scenario is favored for the plausible range of $\beta$. For each merger
scenario, we compute
the (marginalized) probability of producing simulated
values ($s_{proj}$) compatible with the observed location of the radio
relic ($s_{obs}$). 

Quantitatively, we want to compute and compare the probability:  
\begin{align} 
	&P(s_{proj} \text{ compatible with }s_{obs} | M)  \label{eqn:prob}\\
	&=\iint f(S_{proj} \cap S_{obs} | M, \beta) f(\beta | M) d s_{proj} d\beta\\
	&=\iint  f(s_{proj}|M, \beta) f(s_{obs}) f(\beta | M) d s_{proj}
	d\beta, 
\end{align}
where $f$ indicates the corresponding PDF, $M$
represents one of the merger scenarios, and $\beta$ is defined in 
equation~\ref{eqn:NW_speed}, $s_{proj} \in S_{proj}$ and $s_{obs} \in S_{obs}$. 
We set our priors set to be uniform for the marginalization: 
\begin{equation}
	f(\beta | M_{ret}) = f(\beta | M_{out}) =  
	\begin{cases}
		& \text{const}~\text{if } 0.7 \leq \beta \leq 1.5 \\
		& 0~\text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which is more conservative than the most likely range of $\beta$, which is
$0.7 < \beta < 1.1$.
We found: 
\begin{align}
	&P(S_{proj} \cap S_{obs} | M_{ret}) / P(S_{proj} \cap S_{obs} |
	M_{out})\\
	&=
 \begin{cases}
  2.1 \text{ for the NW relic},\\
  460 \text{ for the SE relic},
 \end{cases}
\end{align}
which shows that the returning scenario is favored over the outgoing
scenario. 

This test quantity differs from the traditional hypothesis testing or model comparison in several ways: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item we did not compute a likelihood function.  We have adopted
non-parametric PDFs in our Monte Carlo simulation,i.e. there is no well-known
functional form of the likelihood in our context. We make use of
$f(S_{proj} \cap S_{obs})$ to penalize the simulated values being different from our observed data
\item with this quantity, we are not asking whether the expected value of
	the radio relic such as the mean or median from each model match the
	observation best. Those estimators take into account the values that do not match the observed location of the radio relic. 
\item we marginalized the uncertainty in $\beta$ to be as conservative
	as possible, instead of assuming a fixed value of $\beta$.
\end{enumerate} \par
%The second quantity that we compute is the Wald statistic at a range of possible $\beta$ values.
%Wald statistic is usually used hypothesis testing.
%Computing the Wald statisic allows us to ask, given a particular model (merger
%scenario),
%whether the null value (sample mean) is in the confidence
%interval \citep{Wasserman04}. The Wald statistic that we compute for each model is: 
%\begin{align}
%	W(\beta) = \frac{\bar{s}_{obs} - \mu(\beta)}{\sigma / (n)^{1/2}} 
%\end{align}
%where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\mu(\beta)$, $\sigma$ and $n$ are the
%population mean, population standard deviation and size of samples of the
%simulated model respectively. A higher Wald statistic value would represent
%a larger difference between the observed and model value, while taking into account the model uncertainty. Within the range of
%most likely $0.7 < \beta < 1.5$, the Wald statistic shows that the observed
%relic location is more compatible with the confidence interval of the returning
%scenario. (See Figure~\ref{fig:waldtest})
