\section{INTRODUCTION} 

Galaxies that belongs to a galaxy cluster or group are stochastic samples
of the underlying dark matter mass density. 

We look for summary statistic that would have the least biased estimate of
the dark matter density peak. For stacking the different sets of data, 
find a good proxy for the dark matter density peak is important for the
peak not to be smoothed out. 

As we try to utilize our knowledge of galaxy clusters for precision cosmology,
we need to quantify and propagate our uncertainties carefully.

The main goals of this paper include:
\begin{itemize}
		\item identifying the peak finding methods that would minimize the
			projected galaxy-dark matter offset, which we call $\Delta s$ 
		\item finding variables that characterize the physical state of the
			clusters that show highest correlation with $\Delta s$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Galaxy Clusters and Galaxy Sample}

Sample of clusters/groups: enough massive, enough rich

M200 larger than 1e13 msun implies 129 objects

Most important properties of the galaxy clusters that we examine in this
study include, colors, magnitude, richness, concentration and non-relaxedness. We define
and examined these properties one by one. 

Sample of galaxy members: more than 1e3 particles AND more than 500 stellar particles.

This corresponds to a minimum member mass of TBD and a minimum I-band magnitude of TBD.


Richness characterizes the number of galaxies in a given cluster.


On the relaxedness of the clusters.
We provide several definitions of non-relaxedness to characterize whether
the clusters underwent any recent merger activities. 
1) These definitions of non-relaxedness.
2) 
The Shapiro-Wilk statistic can characterize the deviation from normality
with the highest statistical power ().

\end{figure*}



\subsection{Volume Selection}
As a default output from the Illustris simulation, subhalos and particles of
each galaxy cluster and group is identified by the Rockstar halo finder
(CITATION). We make use of the member particle / subhalo identification as our
default volume selection scheme for each cluster / group.
We understand that this choice of volume selection can be more ideal than
observational conditions. However, we make use of this volume selection scheme
for baseline comparisons. 

Levels of complexity:
\begin{enumerate}
\item FoF members and particles
\item aperture around the center of the simulated FoF, and still only members and particles belonging to the FoF
\item cylinder through the simulated box, centered around the simulated FoF, with a given observationally-motivated aperture, so including background and foreground galaxies.
\end{enumerate}

We start with case 1., assuming that member galaxies can be reliably identified observationally, e.g. thanks to spectroscopic information.




\subsubsection{Spatial Projections}

The center findings are all based on 2D matter projections.

For each cluster, we sample equilateral projections using healPy,
so each angular pixel is of the same size.
We picked 5 evenly spaced elevation values of $\xi$ where $0 \leq \xi \leq \pi / 2$ and 
10 evenly spaced values of $\phi$ where $0 \leq \phi \leq \pi$, to give 50
samples for each cluster with mass $> 10^{14} M_\sun$. 

This method gives us samples of the joint distribution: 
\begin{equation}
	P(\Delta \eta, \phi, \xi, h_{mer}, \psi_g, \psi_D, I_g, I_D | \theta,
	\sigma_{CDM}). 
\end{equation}


Binning the samples based on $\Delta \eta$ and $h_{mer}$ only gives us the
marginal distribution:
\begin{equation}
	P(\Delta \eta, h_{mer} | \theta, \sigma_{CDM}),
\end{equation}
that we have far too few samples of \dots





\subsubsection{Galaxy weights}
One of the most common weighting scheme employed for cluster galaxy data is to weight
by the luminosity in a particular band.

\section{Methods I: Galaxy Centers}

Goal: to identify the ``center'' of the light distribution. Here the adopted tracers for the light distribution are the member galaxies of the cluster and groups.

We focus on four ways to identify the light/galaxy centers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item centroids
\item KDE + peak finder
\item shrinking aperture method
\item brightest cluster galaxy

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Unweighted and weighted centroids}
We follow the usual definition of spatial centroid as 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\bf x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \vec{x}_i. 
\end{equation}
While the weighted centroids are just: 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\bf x}_w = \frac{\sum_i w_i \vec{x}_i}{\sum_i w_i},
\end{equation}
for each spatial dimension and the weights $w_i$ for the $i-th$ galaxy
is described in section.
Centroids and weighted centroids can be biased by merging activities yet do
not provide explicit evidence for ongoing merger or accretion. 


\subsubsection{Cross-validated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the peak finder} 
We employed a KDE algorithm to infer a smooth density distribution of the
galaxies while using smoothed cross-validation to obtain the optimal smoothing
bandwidth matrices ($H$). Specifically, we made use of the KDE function in
the statistical package ks (Duong) in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team 2014).
Cross validation eliminates free parameters in the KDE and minimizes
the asymptotic mean-integrated squared error (AMISE) for a best fit to the
data.
After obtaining the KDE estimate, we employed a finite differencing algorithm
to find the local maxima. We sorted the local maxima according to the KDE
density at the maxima locations and identified the dominant peak. 

Spatial location and the density of the subdominant peaks are also stored.
We investigated if the presence of subdominant peaks are correlated with
$\Delta s$. 

\subsubsection{Shrinking aperture}
Another popular method among astronomers for finding the peak of a spatial
distribution include what we call a shrinking aperture method.
We test if the shrinking aperture method is able to recover the highest peak reliably.
This method is dependent on the initial diameter and the center location of the aperture.
Furthermore, the convergence criteria is not set objectively. We present the
convergence criteria for reference. We note that different implementation may result in
different performances.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Shrinking aperture algorithm}
	\KwData{subhalo that satisfy cuts as a galaxy}
	 \hrulefill

	initial_center = mean(data\_array)\\
 	dist\_array = euclidean_dist(initial_center, data_array)\\
 	apert = get\_90th\_percentile(dist\_array)\\ 
	\While{ (newCenterDist - oldCenterDist) / oldCenterDist $\geq$ 2e-2}{
 		new data array = old data array within apert\\
 		newCenter = mean value of new data along each spatial dimension 
	}   \hrulefill
 \end{algorithm}




\subsubsection{Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG)}

\end{figure*}



\subsection{Comparison of the methods from test data}
In order to examine the performance of commonly used point-estimates of the
distribution of the galaxy data, we test them on data drawn from Gaussian mixtures with
known mean and variance. \\
Fig 1. one Normal mixture \\  
Fig 2. one big normal mixture and one smaller normal mixture \\ 
Fig 3. three bridged normal mixtures \\  
We compare the properties and performance of each of the
methods for finding the peaks of the galaxy and dark matter, 
except the BCG since it does not rely on the cluster member population. 
The main factors that affect the performance of the methods depend heavily on
statistical fluctuations of the drawn data. Namely, the performance of each
method depends on: 1) the
number of Gaussian mixture used, 2) the number of data points in each mixture

Due to the statistical nature of the data, it is not enough to just
compare the performance from applying each method for one realization of the
data. We also provide the 68\% and the 95\% confidence regions from the different methods.


The details and implementation can be found in our Bitbucket git repository.

\subsection{Finding offsets} 

We computed the projected offsets between the galaxy density peaks inferred from the
cross-validated KDE and the dark matter density peak. (TBD) 
The viewing angles of the projections are defined by an elevation angle
$\xi$ and an azimuthal angle $\phi$.

\section{Summary}
We showed that 
\begin{itemize}
		\item  the peak finding method To-be-finalized for the density of cluster
			galaxies is the least biased due to substructures from our test data. 
		\item  all existing peak finding methods have non-negligible uncertainty 
			due to the small number of data points. When dealing with small number of
			cluster samples, the uncertainties of the peak locations should not be
			ignored.
\end{itemize}
