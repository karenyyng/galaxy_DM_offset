\section{INTRODUCTION} 
During the latest stage of structure formation, the universe gave birth to
non-linear, hierarchical structures known as galaxy clusters. 
These clusters, made up of dark matter, galaxies and hot gas,
are constantly accreting mass, merging and evolving with their
environments. Bright galaxies that belong to a galaxy cluster or group, in 
particular, highlight the overdensities of the underlying dark matter (DM) 
distribution. 

% Peaks, summary statistics 
% Modeling galaxy clusters - distributions, peaks, centroids 

In these dense regions of the clusters, the rates of particle
interactions can be enhanced, including the long-suspected self-interaction of DM
particles (hereafter, SIDM).  
Many papers have used the offsets between the summary statistics of the DM
density and the galaxy density to give constraints on 
the self-interaction cross
section, i.e. $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$, of dark matter. 
A lot of observational studies focus on using merging galaxy clusters
as they assume the high collisional velocity should increase the chance
of detecting the effects of SIDM.
By assuming galaxies being relatively collisionless $\sigma_{\rm gal} \approx 0$, 
any offset of the DM population from the galaxy provides $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ 
relative to $\sigma_{\rm gal} \approx 0 \centi\meter^2$. 
These observational studies include \cite{Markevitch2004} and \cite{Bradac2006b}  
reporting an offset of 25 kpc for the Bullet Cluster;  
\cite{Dawson2013} reporting an offset of 129 kpc and 47 kpc for the southern
and the northern subcluster respectively;
\cite{Jee2015} reporting an offset of 190 kpc for MACSJ1752, and others that we
list in detail in table [TODO].
However, other studies using 129 X-ray selected relaxed galaxy clusters, 
such as \cite{George2012a} also report offsets of the same order of magnitude,
at around $50 - 150$ kpc. 

Simulators have also joined hands to study the velocity dependence of the
effects of SIDM. There are many staged simulations of mergers of galaxy
clusters that focused on detecting the signal from
SIDM. These staged simulation usually have parametric prescriptions of the 
spatial distribution of galaxies  
(\citealt{Randall2008d}, \citealt{Kahlhoefer14}, \citealt{Robertson2016}), 
such as an NFW profile, 
and do not have realistic galaxy features, nor dynamical
frictions. 
They try to show the magnitude of offsets solely due to SIDM \citep{Kahlhoefer14} as 
by initializing the galaxy-DM offset to be zero at the beginning of their 
simulations. 
Furthermore, these staged simulations commonly use a much higher number of 
galaxy particles than the realistic observable number of galaxies. 
\cite{Randall2008d} found an offset of only 1.8 kpc in the staged merger
simulation with $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 0 \centi\meter^2 /$ g using $10^5$ 
galaxy particles 
When assumed with zero impact parameter for mergers, Kim and Peter et al.
(2016), using 5.7k or 57k galaxy tracer particles, also show 
null galaxy-DM offset during most periods of their control staged simulation 
with $\sigma_{\rm
SIDM} = 0 \centi\meter^2 /$ g. While we provide a more in-depth comparison with
these staged simulation in the discussion, we argue 
these staged simulations do not probe  
how statistical and observational uncertainties realistically contribute to 
the galaxy-DM offsets. 
As such, any offsets 
from aforementioned staged simulations when they increased $\sigma_{\rm
SIDM}$, they can guarantee the offsets are maximally due to SIDM.
When these simulations set the $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ to observationally motivated 
levels of $< 3$ \centi\meter$^2$/g, 
different authors have consistently reported offset signals  
on par with uncertainties estimated from individual observations. 
These simulations have raised questions about how strongly the galaxy-DM offsets 
can constrain the effects of SIDM.
When \cite{Kahlhoefer14} simulated SIDM with both low-momentum-transfer 
self-interaction 
and rare self-interactions of DM with high momentum transfer, they found maximum 
offsets that are $< 30$ kpc for $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ as high as 1.6
\centi\meter$^2$ / \gram.
The reported offset from \cite{Randall2008d}
for $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 1.24 \centi\meter^2 / \gram$ is only 53.9 kpc. 
While [TODO] Kim and Peter et al. (2016) found a maximum offset $< 50$ kpc for 
$\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 3 \centi\meter^2 / \gram$ ,
and \cite{Robertson2016} also found a maximum offset $\lesssim 50$ kpc  
 from a simulation suite of a Bullet Cluster analog 
 with $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 1~\centi\meter^2 /$ \gram.

An alternative explanation for the observed galaxy-DM offsets is due to 
statistical and observational uncertainties. Galaxies are
sparse samples of the underlying DM overdensities, it is possible that the 
summary statistic of the sparse sample be different from those of the 
underlying distribution. It is not clear if there is any physical
cause of the galaxy-DM offset in a CDM universe, 
but any statistical noise leading to an offset can influence this method of 
inferring $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$. 
Since the Illustris simulation assumes no SIDM, this study is complementary to 
staged simulation for understanding what can contribute to the offsets.
% We therefore, perform mock observations of the galaxies clusters of the
% Illustris simulation to characterize the intrinsic scatter of the offsets.  
Simply put, we perform a hypothesis test with the galaxy-DM offsets in
the Illustris simulation directly corresponding to our null hypothesis
$\mathcal{H}_0$, with: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
	\text{the null hypothesis }\mathcal{H}_0: \text{Cold Dark Matter (CDM)} \\
	\text{the alternative hypothesis }\mathcal{H}_1: \text{Self-interacting Dark
	Matter (SIDM)} 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

% This is the first study to compare the magnitude of SIDM offset signal with
% statistical noise, such as projection effects and unknown dynamical history. 
% These latent variables are confounding and can increase the variance of
% the population distribution of the galaxy-DM offsets.  

This exercise is further complicated by the fact that there is no theoretical
foundation showing which observable would be the most sensitive to each
possible type of SIDM. In fact, \cite{Kahlhoefer14} have argued that SIDM 
does not cause
significant offsets between the galaxy and DM peaks, and only cause an offset
between the corresponding centroids for a brief period of time after a merger. 
% To access if the offsets we observe is
% completely explained by the method for computing the offset, we investigate   
% the precision to which we can find the galaxy-DM offsets.  
Popular choice for computing the offsets involves first inferring the summary
statistic of the DM population and those of the galaxy population of a cluster
independently before taking a difference.
While there are well established procedures driven by lensing physics for 
inferring the DM spatial distribution, there is no standard procedure for
mapping the sparse member galaxy distribution. 
We quantify the bias and uncertainty associated with the one-point summary
statistic for summarizing member galaxy population. 

Understanding the characteristics of different galaxy
summary statistics of clusters are also important for  
probing the matter fluctuations in the universe. 
Galaxy clusters probe the large fluctations in the matter power spectrum.
As most large scale surveys are only in the optical, it is important to
understand the characteristics of different summary statistics of galaxy
populations of clusters.
Performing lensing analyses on the stacked images of 
many small galaxy groups and clusters can give constraints to cosmological
parameters. Stacking on the `wrong' centers is a commonly cited
source of uncertainties. By comparing the discrepancies of different galaxy
summary, we can shed light to what can help maximize the lensing signal and 
the possible cause(s) of miscentering. 

% % What are the observational methods for summarizing dark matter distribution?
% % Weak and strong lensing are the most reliable methods for mapping the dark 
% % matter distribution in a galaxy cluster. 
% % Common to all the methods are the estimation of the density peaks. 
% % Uncertainties affect the conclusion for the computation the hypothesis test / parameter
% % estimation
% % Previous work on quantifying galaxy-DM offsets included  
% % What centroids they have used
% % 
% % Physical motivation for using the galaxy density peak 
% % Observation footprints 
% % 
% % Under the assumed Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, it is unclear 
% % that how large the offset $\Delta \vec{s}$ should be. 
% % % Why use simulation data to study the populations? 
% % Other complications for studying galaxy clusters arise from observation
% % limitations. There is not a lot of information that can help constrain the  
% % line-of-sight distance of different components of a cluster. 
% 
% 
% % Goals of the paper
% % With the advent of large-scale optical sky surveys, 
% % the number of identified galaxy clusters is growing quickly. 
% % Existing catalogs such as the Abell catalog also contain
% % peaks inferred
% % from the different peak finding methods and the DM peaks. 
% % at least 4000 clusters with at least 30 members. 
% % The future Large Synoptic Sky Survey alone will identify over a hundred thousand galaxy
% % clusters (CITE) in optical wavelengths. 
% % It is important to verify the uncertainties associated with common
% % summary statistics for studying galaxy clusters. Considering the large quantity
% % of data, methods with manual tuning will not scale well. The manual biases may
% % also make it hard to obtain consistent statistics from the samples.

In this paper, we 
1) extract realistic observables from the Illustris simulation for
comparison with observations, 2) explore the pros and cons of the different statistic for 
summarizing {\it the member galaxy population} of a galaxy cluster, 3)	
give estimates for the offsets between the summary statistics of the galaxy  
population and the DM population under $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, which we call 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \vec{s} \equiv \vec{s}_{\rm gal} - \vec{s}_{\rm DM}.
\end{equation}
where $\bf{s}_{gal}$ and $\bf{s}_{DM}$ are the two-dimensional (2D) spatial
locations of the summary statistic of the galaxy population, and the density
peak of DM respectively. This gives
an estimate of the baseline scatter of offsets without any SIDM. And finally we 
4) examine the properties of the clusters that give outliers in 
the offset distribution and 5) investigate the  
correlations between the physical properties of a cluster and the projected 
observables such as $\Delta s$.

% Basic setup 
The organization of this paper is as follows:
In section \ref{sec:illustris_sim}, we will describe the physical properties of 
the data of the Illustris
simulation (\citealt{Vogelsberger2014}, \citealt{Genel2014a}), 
and the selection criteria that we have employed to ensure that the
quantities that we examine resemble observables but without noise and
systematics from observations. 
Then in section \ref{sec:methods}, 
we explain the methods for computing various 
one-point statistics of the spatial distribution of galaxies how we prepare our dark
matter spatial data to resemble convergence maps. We show the statistical performance
of the different summary statistics before we show the main results
in section \ref{sec:results}. In the discussion in section \ref{sec:discussion}, 
we list the implications of our
results and compare it to other simulations and observations. We also 
show how one may make use of the population offset statistical distribution
from the Illustris data to construct a test with 
a null hypothesis of $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 0$ and discuss the caveats. 

	Our analysis makes use of the same flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology
as the Illustris simulation. The relevant cosmological parameters are
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7274, \Omega_m = 0.2726$, and $H_0 = 70.4$
km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$.

\section{THE ILLUSTRIS SIMULATION DATA} 
\label{sec:illustris_sim}
The Illustris simulation contains some of the most
realistic, simulated galaxies to date, making it especially suitable for 
verifying the properties of galaxy clusters. We obtained our data from 
snapshot number 135 (cosmological $z=0$) of the Illustris-1 simulation. The Illustris-1
simulation has the highest particle resolution and has incorporated the most 
comprehensive baryonic physics among the different Illustris simulation suites. 
The sophisticated galaxy formation model in Illustris-1 
includes star formation rate, and stellar evolution due to
environmental effects of the intracluster medium, such as ram pressure stripping and
strangulation and feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) etc. \citep{Genel2014a}.
The physics of stellar
evolution were solved using a moving mesh code {\bf \texttt{AREPO}} \citep{Springel2010}.
The observable properties of galaxies were statistically consistent
with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data
\citep{Vogelsberger2014}. 

As the stellar population in Illustris were evolved from the initial condition,
these makes the spatial distribution of galaxies in  Illustris data more 
realistic than galaxies that are prescribed onto DM-only cosmological
simulation data such as those used in \cite{Harvey2013d}.  
Gravitational effects in Illustris-1 have provided realistic dynamics and
spatial distribution of subhalos. The simulated effects include
tidal stripping, dynamical friction and merging. 
Since the profile of the galaxies clusters were not
provided in symmetrical, parametric forms, we can study 
how asymmetry in the cluster profile affects the estimate of our summary 
statistic. This data allows us to examine cluster galaxies
in a realistic, yet noise-free way. The softening length of the DM particles is
1.4 kpc and those of the stellar particles is 
0.7 kpc, both in constant comoving units \citep{Genel2014a}.

The two sets of data catalogs in use are obtained through two types of halo
finders. The catalog that maps particles to the halo of a certain cluster was 
created by the {\bf \texttt{SUBFIND}} algorithm. The friends-of-friends (FoF) 
finder \citep{Davis1985} was further used to identify the affinity
of galaxy-sized halos to a galaxy-cluster. 
These galaxy-size halos are referred to as {\it subhalos} and 
they are the dark matter hosts of what we refer to as galaxies in Illustris-1. 
\cite{Vogelsberger2014a} also extracted the 
absolute magnitude of each subhalo in
the SDSS bands of $g, r, i, z$ as part of the {\bf
\texttt{SUBFIND}} catalog using stellar population synthesis models.

For our analyses, we make use of galaxy clusters / groups 
with at least 50 member galaxies that are within a reasonable observational limit, 
i.e. apparent $i \leq 24.4$ which is the limiting magnitude of the DEIMOS
spectrometer on the Keck telescope when we assume a cosmological redshift of $z = 0.3$
in the $i$ band. The limiting magnitude of 24.2 in the
F814W filter of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the limiting magnitude of the
Canadian-Hawaii French Telescope of 24.5, 
are also close to our chosen limiting magnitude. 
There is relatively large statistical uncertainty if we try
to analyze clusters with less than 50 member galaxies. 
As indicated by the right-hand panel of Fig. \ref{fig:mass_richness}, 
a total of 43 clusters have 
survived this magnitude cut. These simulated galaxy clusters (or groups) have 
masses ranging from $10^{13}$ M$_\odot $ to $10^{14}$ M$_\odot$.

\subsection{Cluster properties}
\label{subsec:cluster_properties}

\subsubsection{Relaxedness of the galaxy clusters}
\label{subsubsec:relaxedness}

Clusters undergo merger activities of a large range of physical scales and 
in the time scale of million of years. 
The dynamical history, or what we call ``unrelaxedness" is hard to retrieve from 
simulations across different saved states and is missing from observations.
We quantify the state of the cluster by providing several quantitative
definitions of unrelaxedness and see how they correlate with $\Delta s$.
Some possible definition of unrelaxedness referred by the simulation community
include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item unrelaxedness$_0$: the ratio of mass outside the dominant dark matter halo over the total mass
		of the galaxy cluster. The lower the ratio, the less substructures there
		are in the cluster. 
	\item unrelaxedness$_1$: the distance between the most bound particle from the center of mass as a
		function of R$_{200c}$, the three-dimensional (3D) radius in which the
		average density is 200 times the critical density of the universe. 
		The smaller the distance, there are less asymmetric 
		substructures. 
	% \item [TODO] velocity dispersion from selected galaxies those selection
	% 	criteria will be explained in  
\end{itemize}
which are computable from the Illustris data. 
To relate these simulation quantities, we compute more observation oriented 
quantities in the method section \ref{subsubsec:KDE}. 
The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
(aka Pearson's r,  hereafter $\rho$) of the first
two unrelaxedness criteria for the 43 selected clusters is as high as 0.82. 

\subsection{Selection of the field-of-view}
\label{sec:FOV}

\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{180mm} 
	\caption{ Selection criteria for stellar subhalos (member galaxies) for each
		cluster / group 
\label{tab:member_galaxy_selections}} 
	\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\hline 
Data &  Selection strategy  & Sensitivity & Relevant section  \\ \hline
Field of view (FOV) & FoF halo finder& comparable to FOV of the Subaru
Suprime camera & \ref{sec:FOV}  \\ 
Observed filter & $i$-band & consistent among the redder $r, i, z$ bands &   
\ref{subsec:galaxy_properties}
\\ 
Cluster richness  & $i \leq 24.4$ and $z = 0.3$  & sensitive to
the assumed cosmological redshift of cluster and & \ref{sec:illustris_sim} \\ 
& & the assumed limiting magnitude of telescope &   \\
Two-dimensional projections & even HEALPix samples over half a sphere &
discussed as results  & \ref{subsubsec:projections}\\  
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\footnotesize{
}
\end{minipage}
\end{center} 
\end{table*}

We make use of the {\bf \texttt{SUBFIND}} member particle for the DM and the 
{\bf \texttt{FoF}} subhalo identification as our
default volume selection scheme for each cluster / group.
We understand that this choice of volume selection can be more ideal than
observational conditions. We make use of this volume selection scheme
for baseline comparisons. 

Assuming a conservative line-of-sight (los) distance 
, i.e. cosmological redshift, with [TODO] $z = 0.3$, 
the projected extent for most of the Illustris galaxy clusters and groups, 
fits inside the field of view of telescopes, such as the Subaru Suprime Camera,
which covers a physical area of [TODO] $\sim 9$ Mpc $\times 7$ Mpc 
(See \href{https://goo.gl/ClZNvM}{https://goo.gl/ClZNvM} for a Jupyter notebook 
showing the extent of the Dark Matter distribution of the most massive 129
clusters).

\subsubsection{Spatial Projections}
\label{subsubsec:projections}
Unlike in staged simulation, picking out a particular projection for a cluster 
does not always make physical sense.
For highly symmetrical clusters, most projections are similar. 
However, for mergers or asymmetrical clusters, 
there is no obvious choice for the plane of projection that can allow us to
understand the cluster. There is no simplistic merger axis that should be 
projected along the plane of the field of view due to possible 3D spiraling
trajectories of the merging components. 

We therefore compute observables based on even sampling of angular orientation 
as our line-of-sight.
As the order of projecting the data and estimating the summary statistic is
non-commutative, we first project the data before estimating any projected 
observable. 
The computation of even angular orientation 
is done by using HealPy, which is a Python wrapper for
{\bf \texttt{HEALPix}} \footnote{HEALPix is
currently hosted at http://healpix.sourceforge.net}
\citep{Gorski2005}. Each line-of-sight centers on a {\bf \texttt{HEALPix}} 
pixel.
The number of projections that we employed is 768 for each cluster. With around 
768 projections, the offset distributions of each cluster start to converge to a
stable distribution. 
Even though there are at least 2 identical projections for each cluster due to
one possible line-of-sight from the front and one from the back, it does not
affect any summary statistic. We do not remove the duplication as it breaks
the rotational symmetry in the 2D plane when we try to compute the 2D population
distribution of offsets.  
% Details of the implementation of the projection is available in Appendix
% \ref{app:projections}.


\subsection{Properties of the galaxies in Illustris clusters}
\label{subsec:galaxy_properties}

Different galaxies have different masses, so they should not be considered with equal
importance for peak identification, which requires summing
the mass proxies of different galaxies. One of the most common weighting schemes employed for galaxy data is to weight
by the luminosity in a particular band. For some of the methods, we investigate
the differences in peak identification with and without any luminosity weights.
We pick the $i-$band magnitude
associated with each subhalo as the weight. Since the $i-$band is
one of the redder bands, the mass-to-light ratio is not skewed as much due to star
formation activities. 
We further examined if the colors distribution of galaxies in Illustris-1 are
similar to the observed color-magnitude diagrams for clusters.
The Illustris cluster galaxies are realistic enough that it is easy to
identify an overdense region of galaxies known as the red-sequence in the 
color-magnitude diagram such as Fig.
\ref{fig:color_magnitude_diagram}. The red-sequence is prominent even if we
use other colors formed by different combinations of the $r, i, z$ bands.

\section{METHODS}\label{sec:methods}
A common and the most precise way of summarizing the DM distribution in a
galaxy cluster is by finding the lensing peaks 
(\citealt{Medezinski2013}, \citealt{Markevitch2004}, \citealt{Zitrin13}).
Additionally, the peak region is physically 
interesting due to the higher particle density and interaction rates. 
The most direct analogous statistic for summarizing the member galaxy
population in a cluster is therefore, also the peak. 
Comparing the DM peak with the summary statistics of the galaxy population that
are not the peak therefore can have an {\it offset} purely due to the difference in
the choice of the statistic for summarizing the two sets of identically
distributed data. 
We will state the definition and implementation of five commonly used 
point statistic or location for summarizing 
the member galaxy population in a galaxy cluster.

We avoid any manual methods for
comparison purposes, scalability and reproducibility. 
Since all the methods listed in this
paper are automated with the source code openly available, 
it is possible for future studies to reuse our code for comparisons. 
% There are a number of decisions ($\sim $[TODO] ADD NUMBER) that one needs to make to 
% determine the summary statistics. We will try to address the sensitivity of the offset
% due to each decision. 
Furthermore, a major advantage for automation is that it allows us  
to apply
the same methods across the different snapshots of the (Illustris) simulations to
examine the variability of $\Delta s$ across time in future studies. 


\subsubsection{Computing the weighted centroid}
\label{subsubsec:weighted_centroid}
We follow the usual definition of the weighted centroid: 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\bf x}_w = \frac{\sum_i w_i \vec{x}_i}{\sum_i w_i},
\end{equation}
with $\vec{x}_i$ being the positional vector of each subhalo 
and we use the $i$-band luminosity 
as the weight $w_i$ for the $i$-th galaxy.
Centroids can be biased by subcomponents from merging activities yet the
centroid estimate do not provide explicit evidence for ongoing merger or 
accretion. These estimates are also sensitive to odd boundaries 
of the field of view.

\subsubsection{Cross-validated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the peak finder} 
\label{subsubsec:KDE}
Finding the exact peak of a sets of data points 
involves computing the density estimate of the data points and sorting through
the density estimates. A specific version of this density estimation process is
known as histogramming. During the making of histogram, each data point is
given some weight using a tophat kernel and the weights are summed up at
specific data locations (e.g. $\bf{x}_i$). 
Histogram is not good for peak estimate for {\it sparse} data for two reasons: 1) the
choice of laying down the bin boundaries affects the count in each bin, 2) the choice of
bin width also affects the count in the bin. Only when the available number of data points
for binning is large, the estimates of histograms and smoothed density
estimates are approximately the same. The number of member galaxies ($< 500$) 
is sparse enough for the uncertainty introduced by histogramming to bias our
peak estimate. For the density estimate of galaxy luminosity, 
we adopt a Gaussian kernel. 
The exact choice of the functional form of the smoothing kernel does
not dominate the density estimate as long as the chosen kernel is
smooth \citep{Feigelson2014}. 

The most important parameter of computing the density estimate is the bandwidth
 of the smoothing kernel, which takes the form of a matrix in the 2D case. 
 We illustrate the choice of kernel width with Fig.
\ref{fig:bias_variance_tradeoff}. When the kernel width is
too large (bottom left panel), the data is over-smoothed, 
resulting in a bias of the peak estimate. On the other hand, when the kernel
width is too small, it results in high variances of the estimate and result in
too many peaks due to noise. The decision of having to balance between creating high
bias or high variance estimates is also known as the bias-variance tradeoff. 
Any other smoothing procedures, including interpolation with splines,
polynomials, and filter convolutions, also face the same tradeoff. 

\begin{figure*}
	% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figN_mass_richness.eps}
	\caption{This figure is adapted from \citealt{Vanderplas2012} from

under the fair use of the BSD license. \label{fig:bias_variance_tradeoff} }
\end{figure*}
A well-known way to minimize the fitting error from the density estimate is through
a data-based approach called cross-validation to obtain 
the optimal 2D smoothing
bandwidth matrix ($\Hmat$) of the 2D Gaussian kernel for the
density estimate $\hat{f}$:
\begin{align}
	\hat{f}(\chi; \Hmat) &= \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}|\Hmat|^{1/2}}
	\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \exp((\chi-{\bf x}_i)^T H^{-1} (\chi-{\bf x}_i)),
	\label{eq:cross_validated_bandwidth}
\end{align}
where the dimensionality is $d=2$ for our projected quantities,
$\chi$ represents the uniform grid points for evaluation, and 
$\bf{x}_i$ contains the spatial coordinates for each of the identified member 
galaxies that survived our brightness cut and $w_i$ is again the $i-$band
luminosity weights for each galaxy.
The idea behind cross-validation is to leave a small fraction of data point 
out as the test set, and use the rest of the data points as 
the training set for computing the estimated density.
Then it is possible to estimate and minimize the asymptotic mean-integrated squared error
(AMISE)  by searching
for the best set of bandwidth matrix values, eliminating any free parameter. 

Specifically, we made use of the smoothed-cross validation \citep{Hall1992} 
bandwidth selector in the statistical package {\bf \texttt{ks}} \citep{Duong2007} 
in the {\bf \texttt{R}} statistical computing environment \citep{R_core}. 
Among all the different {\bf \texttt{R}} packages, {\bf \texttt{ks}} is the
only package capable of handling the magnitude weights of the data points 
while inferring the density estimates \citep{Deng2011}. 
Although the particular implementation of KDE has a computational runtime of $O(n^2)$, 
the number of cluster galaxies is
small enough for this method to finish quickly ($\lesssim 2$ second per
projection per cluster). 

After obtaining the KDE estimate, we employed both a first and second-order  
finite differencing algorithm to find the local maxima.  
The local maxima were then sorted according to the KDE density in a descending
fashion before we perform peak matching and compute the offset. The exact
procedure is discussed in section \ref{subsec:offsets}. 

For each projection of each cluster, we normalize the density of all 
luminosity peaks to those of the brightest peak. 
Then we sum the density of all the galaxy peaks for a cluster and call this value
$\nu$. When the value of $\nu$ much gets bigger than 1, it indicates the presence 
of projected substructure(s). Even though 
$\nu$ is not expressed in terms of masses, it is a practical measurement
for optical survey data where only galaxy magnitudes, but not spatial mass distribution from lensing
estimates, are available. 

\subsubsection{Shrinking aperture estimates}

Another popular method among astronomers for finding the peak of a spatial
distribution is what we call the shrinking aperture method.
While we do not endorse this method,
we test if the shrinking aperture method is able to reliably recover the 
peak of the luminosity map.
This method is dependent on the initial diameter and the initial center 
location of the aperture.
This method does not evaluate if the cluster is made up of
several components.
The estimate using the shrinking aperture algorithm can be biased by
substructures. The only way to inform the algorithm about substructures would
be to introduce another parameter to restrict the extent of the aperture, or to
partition the data with another (statistical) algorithm.
Furthermore, the convergence of results of this method is unstable. We use a
convergence criteria of having the aperture distance not change more than 2\% 
between successive iterations as a reference. The actual implementation in
Python can be found at \href{https://goo.gl/nqxJl8}{https://goo.gl/nqxJl8} while
the pseudo-code can be find in Appendix \ref{app:shrink_apert}.

\subsubsection{Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG)}
The BCGs are formed by the merger of many smaller
galaxies. The galaxy-cannibalism makes BCGs typically brighter than the rest of 
the cluster galaxy population by several orders of magnitude. 
However, star formation can cause
less massive galaxies to be brighter in the bluer photometric bands.
To avoid star formation from biasing our algorithm for identifying the
BCG, we find the brightest galaxies in redder bands i.e. the $r, i, z$
bands and found that they give consistent results for all selected clusters. 
We used the $i-$band to pick the BCG for computing the plots and the final results.

\end{figure*}



\subsection{Comparison of the methods from Gaussian mixture data}
In order to examine the statistical properties of commonly used point-
estimates of the distribution of the galaxy data, we test them on data drawn 
from Gaussian mixtures with known mean and variance. (See Fig.
\ref{fig:toy_data_mixtures}). The main factors that affect the performance of 
the methods are sensitive to the statistical fluctuations of the drawn data, 
e.g. the
spatial distribution of the data, including 1) the density profile and 2) the
location(s) of subdominant mixtures,
, and 3) the number of data points that we draw.
It is also not enough to just
compare the performance by applying each method for one realization of the
data. We provide the 68\% and the 95\% confidence regions by applying the
each method for many Monte Carlo realizations.
In general, the peaks identified from the KDE density is closer to the 
peak of the dominant mixture (more accurate) than 
both the weighted centroid method and the shrinking aperture method.
For example, in the bottom middle panel of fig. \ref{fig:toy_data_mixtures}, 
it is clear that the green contours
that represents the confidence region for the shrinking aperture peak is
biased due to the substructure, whereas the confidence region for the centroid 
is so biased that it is outside the field of view of that panel.
For the bottom right panel of fig. \ref{fig:toy_data_mixtures}, 
we present how the confidence region shrinks as the
number of data points increases.
From that here is also a catastrophic outlier for the shrinking 
aperture method for 500 data
points. The outlier shows how the shrinking aperture method can have
radical behavior when there are subclusters in the data.	

\subsection{Modeling the DM map in Illustris-1 and the lensing kernel}
The most well established method of inferring the projected dark matter spatial 
distribution from observations is through gravitational lensing.
It works by detecting subtle image distortions of background galaxies due to
the foreground dark matter. The resolution of the inferred map therefore 
depends on the properties of the source galaxies that are being lensed, 
such as the projected number density, the intrinsic ellipticities and morphology etc.
To achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for lensing, 
\cite{Hoag2016} has performed simulation for inferring the optimal bandwidth
for a Gaussian smoothing kernel for the cluster MACSJ0416. 
In the strong lensing regime, \cite{Hoag2016} found a resolution of 11 arcseconds
can best fit the MACSJ0416 data. A kernel bandwidth (this is the standard deviation) 
of 11 arcseconds translates to an angular diameter distance of 50 
kpc assuming a cosmological redshift of $z \approx 0.3$. 
\cite{Clowe2012} also described using a 60 kpc radial Gaussian kernel to smooth out spikes
in the weak lensing map of Abell 520. In order to match the resolution of lensing data,
we also employed a smoothing kernel of similar physical size.  

To compute the DM spatial distribution from our data, we first make histogram with 2 kpc
$\times$ 2 kpc bin size which is slightly larger than the DM softening length of 1.4 kpc. 
After that, we use a (50, 50) kpc 2D radial Gaussian kernel 
to smooth the DM histogram Illustris DM
particle data. 
There are resolution differences between the smoothed and unsmoothed DM
maps. The unsmoothed histograms tend to show many more local maxima around the major
density peaks (i.e. show high variance). 
The number of DM particles for each cluster is of 
[TODO double check] the order of millions and densely packed in the region of
interest. 
Physically, the smoothed histograms of the dark matter of each cluster 
is analogous to a convergence map from a lensing analysis. 


\subsection{Finding the offsets} \label{subsec:offsets}
It is possible to have several peak estimates from the KDE of the member galaxy 
population of a cluster. 
From the density estimate at each peak, we can sort 
the peaks according to their densities. We only match luminosity 
peaks that are at 
least 20\% as dense as the brightest galaxy-luminosity peak to avoid 
computing the offsets of spurious substructures, such as the peaks due to 
small number of galaxies that are located far away from the main concentration of mass.

In general, there are many more DM peaks because there are many more dark 
subhalos than galaxies for each cluster and the resolution of the DM data is
much higher. To find the nearest DM peak to the significant galaxy peaks just as any
astronomers would do manually,  
we construct a k-dimensional tree (KD-Tree; in our case, k = 2) 
using the densest $n_{\rm DM}$  number of DM peaks:
\begin{equation}
	n_{\rm DM} = \begin{cases}		
		3 \times (n_{gal} + 1) & {\rm if~} n_{gal} < 3 \\
	3 \times n_{gal}  & {\rm if~} n_{gal} \geq 3.
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:peak_threshold}
\end{equation}
where $n_{gal}$ is the number of significant galaxy peak, and $n_{\rm DM}$
is the number of peaks that went into the construction of the KD-tree.
When there are more
than one dense galaxy peaks located far away from one another, 
the top few densest DM peaks (subhalos) 
can be located around the same galaxy peak.
i.e. there is no one-to-one matching between the luminosity of galaxies and the
density of detected DM peaks.
Matching purely based on density and luminosity leads to larger offsets.
From inspection, using eq. (\ref{eq:peak_threshold}) works well to match the 
appropriate peaks. We also show in the result section that most of the chosen DM peaks
do not have significant deviation from the most gravitationally bound particles.
After identifying the DM peaks, we also compute the 
offsets 
between the DM peaks, and the following spatial estimates, including 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the most (gravitationally) bound particle 
	\item the shrinking aperture peaks, the corresponding offset is $\Delta s_{\rm
		shrink}$, 
	\item the number density peaks, the corresponding offset is $\Delta s_{\rm
		num.dens}$, 
	\item the BCGs, the corresponding offset is $\Delta s_{\rm BCG}$ and
\item the luminosity weighted centroid, the corresponding offset is $\Delta s_{\rm BCG}$.
\end{itemize}
Since there can be more than one number density peak from the corresponding KDE
map, we also use a KD-tree to location the closest number density peak to the 
identified DM peak.

[TODO] Figure out how the Illustris simulation figure out the most bound 
particle.
The most bound particle is the location with minimum 
gravitational potential of the {\bf \texttt{Subfind}} identified cluster.
Due to substructures, it is possible for there to be several minima of similar 
gravitational potential level. 

\subsection{Constructing the hypothesis test} 

After matching the peaks, we use the offsets as the basis of our 
 hypothesis test. 
We compute the p-value as the highest density interval of simulated offsets 
that are below observed values of 
offsets in the literature. The distribution of offsets in the Illustris
simulation represents the possible ways that offsets would be observed in a CDM
universe.
This gives us a rough estimation of the probability 
of seeing the offset from observations under the null hypothesis of CDM 
being true. We also provide the biweight location and the density interval 
characterizing the 
distribution of offsets computed from each of the listed methods.
For instance, the 95\% interval is computed as the interval that encompasses
95\% of total density (2.5\% of density mass at each end of the tail is
excluded). In case of degeneracy, the interval is also required to cover the 
location estimate for the distribution.

The different representations of the distributions of $\Delta s$ have different 
statistical power for the hypothesis test, i.e. there are discrepancies between
the spread of the offset distributions, so
it affects the significance of an observation. 
The most faithful representation of the offsets without any information loss
is:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta {\bf s} = ({\bf x}_{\rm gal} - {\bf x}_{\rm DM}, 
	{\bf y}_{\rm gal} - {\bf y}_{\rm DM} ).
	\label{eq:2D_offsets}
\end{equation}
The PDF of $\Delta {\bf s}$ in eq. \ref{eq:2D_offsets} peaks at (0, 0) when there is no real offset.
However, when one takes the magnitude of $\Delta {\bf s}$, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
	|\Delta {\bf s}| = \sqrt{({\bf x}_{\rm gal} - {\bf x}_{\rm DM})^2 + 
	({\bf y}_{\rm gal} - {\bf y}_{\rm DM})^2},
	\label{eq:magnitude_offsets}
\end{equation}
the resulting 1D distribution of $|\Delta {\bf s}|$, 
those support being [0, $\infty$),
will not peak at zero even if the original
distribution of $\Delta {\bf s}$ peaks at (0, 0). 
This effect is seen in the distribution of $|\Delta {\bf s}|$ recorded in
\ref{tab:offset_distributions} for the results.
For an asymmetrical 1D distribution, finding the narrowest 68\% and 95\% interval
is not a standard statistical procedure and can be prone to error.
On the other hand, 
the 1D distributions of offsets along a particular spatial axis, 
e.g. $\Delta {\bf x}$ and $\Delta {\bf y}$,
each with a support of $\mathbb{R}$, will not exhibit a discontinuity at zero.
Their distributions should also be symmetrical so 
the highest density interval is easier to find.
Since we have enough samples for there to be
rotational symmetry for the distribution of $(\Delta {\bf x}, \Delta {\bf y})$,
we will show that it does not
matter much if we picked $\Delta {\bf x}$ or $\Delta {\bf y}$ for the 1D representation.
We compute the hypothesis test significance level with the 
 offset $\Delta {\bf x}$ along one of the spatial axes. 
% There is a more comprehensive discussion of the representation of offset 
% distributions and the complications due to the different projections of the
% clusters in Appendix [TODO].

\subsection{Relaxedness of the clusters}
Out of the $43 \times 768 = 33 024$ projections, $\sim 45\%$ of the projections 
have one dominant luminosity peak and negligible substructures, with the total peak density of the
projection being $\nu \leq 1.2$. 
Another $\sim 50\%$ of the projections have more than one dominant luminosity
peak with $1.2 < \nu < 2.2$. 
From Fig. \ref{fig:total_peak_dens_distribution} that shows the spread of $\nu$
estimate over different projections, 
most clusters show signs of other subdominant peaks.

Visually, the spread of the $\nu$ distribution is indicated by the horizontal 
length of the blue box. 
the median of $\nu$ per cluster are indicated by the red central vertical line
inside each box in Fig. 
\ref{fig:total_peak_dens_distribution}).
Only 7 clusters (with ID = 15, 16, 17, 22, 31, 35, 51) out of 43 clusters have $\nu
\lesssim 1.2$ for most of the projections.
Clusters with median values of $\nu > 2.2$ usually have multiple subclusters.
Cluster with ID = 7, for instance, are made up of around 4 disconnected clusters that span
several Mpc.  
There is also a strong correlation of $\sim 0.8$ 
between each of the two unrelaxedness quantities defined in section 
\ref{subsubsec:relaxedness}
and the median of $\nu$ over different projections of each cluster. 


\subsection{Offset between the matched DM peaks and the corresponding most
bound particle}
There is no significant differences between the matched DM peaks and i
the most gravitationally 
bound particle (hereafter most bound particle).
The median of the offset between the DM peak and the gravitationally bound
particle is (0, 0) kpc. The 75-th percentile of the offsets are at ($\pm2,\pm2$) kpc. 
Most of the other offset values occur below ($\pm 9, \pm 9$). Large offsets
are only seen for clusters with $\nu > 1.2$. 


\subsection{Offset between galaxy summary statistic and the most bound particle}
As a sanity check, we computed the offsets between different galaxy summary
statistic and the most bound particle. 
Interested reader can refer to table
\ref{tab:most_bound_particle_offset_distributions} for the different
percentile and robust estimates of the distribution of offsets from the most bound 
particle. 
The ranking in terms of increasing distance 
to the most bound particle computed by different method is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item BCG 
	\item densest peak of the luminosity map created by weighted the KDE 
		\item shrinking aperture center from the luminosity weighted galaxy data
		\item densest peak of the number density map created by the unweighted KDE 
		\item centroid estimate using luminosity weights, which is a proxy for the
			center of mass
\end{itemize}

In fact, most of the BCG offsets are very small except for two clusters with ID 13
and 33. Both clusters have all the values  of $\nu > 1.5 $ over different projections. 
From the projected density map, we further confirm that
both clusters have significant substructures. It is therefore possible for the
most bound particle to have similar gravitational potential level as another 
substructure where the BCG is located. 
In general, the offset distributions between the galaxy summary statistics and
the most bound particle have approximately the same level of variance but more
extreme outliers (at the 99\%) than the
offset distribution between the DM peaks and the corresponding galaxy summary
statistics.

\subsection{Galaxy-DM Offset in Illustris}
\subsubsection{The two-dimensional distribution and distribution of $\Delta y$}
The 2D distribution of $\Delta s$ from most methods peak at
around zero ($\lesssim 4$ kpc) with high rotational symmetry. 
The luminosity weighted centroid offset, i.e. median($\Delta x_{\rm
centroid}'$ = -37 kpc) has the highest asymmetry along x-axis for the peak.
These offsets distributes are recorded in detail in table
\ref{tab:offset_distributions}. 

The estimates of the offsets from each method, are summarized with the biweight 
location statistic \citep{Beers90}.
However, the population spread of $\Delta s$ computed by each method 
differ enough that one needs to know which offset method an astronomical study
used for a fair comparison. 

The 2D offset $\Delta s_{\rm BCG}$ has most of its density located near zero but 
contains outliers. Having outlier is possible 
because the DM peak is chosen as the closest DM peak to match the
brightest luminosity peak in a particular projection.
See bottom right panel of \ref{fig:select_peak_visualization}, the BCG is identified to
coincide with the most bound particle. However, the luminosity peak of the
cluster is located at the other mass substructure. 
When there are distantly separated subclusters of similar masses, 
the brightest projected luminosity peak 
may shift from one subcluster to another subcluster between different projections,
while the BCG identification is unchanged between projections.
The aforementioned bias from substructure can be seen when we compare the
offset estimates between the relatively relaxed sample of $\nu < 1.2$ and the
unrelaxed samples $1.2 < \nu < 2.2$. The 99-th percentile increased drastically
from $\pm 19$ kpc to an asymmetrical extreme estimates of $(-684, +1570)$ kpc.
Again, these values are possible because there can be several DM peaks of
similar density due to subclusters located far apart from one another.
The finite number of projections, combined with the substructures, can cause 
the 95-th and 99-th percentile tails of $\Delta y_{\rm BCG}$ of both the full
sample and the unrelaxed sample exhibit noticeable asymmetry, 
but not the relaxed samples.
Some field of views of the same cluster can be similar and happen to project the
cluster along its longest extent.
[TODO verify] It is likely that elongated clusters, such as cluster 7, and cluster 33,
are responsible such asymmetry.

The other offset estimates also exhibit difference variance.
For the full sample in table \ref{tab:p_val_table} and fig. 
\ref{fig:offset_distributions},
the offsets computed by the peak from the luminosity weighted KDE 
has the second smallest variance. The 68-th percentile of $\Delta y_{\rm
KDE}'$ is at $\pm 25$ kpc. Using shrinking aperture to estimate
the peak location from the luminosity map increased the 68-th percentile of the
offset to more than double those of $\Delta y_{\rm KDE}'$ at $\pm 65$ kpc.
The peak estimate from the number density map has even larger variance, 
with its 68-th percentile being $\pm 84$ kpc. 

Most of the percentile intervals of the unrelaxed samples $ 1.2 < \nu < 2.2$ , 
when compared to the relaxed samples, are around a factor of 2 larger. 
With the relatively relaxed samples, the variance of the inferred offsets from different
methods still show significant discrepancies. 
The variance of the offset computed from the shrinking aperture method, 
the number density map, and the weighted centroid are still at least a factor of 1.5
larger than those computed using the luminosity-weighted KDE. 
In particular, the 68\% percentile of the centroid method is $\pm 108$ kpc.
This is around one-fourth the typical core radius of massive clusters
\citep{Allen1998}.  
 
The spread of the offsets inferred by each method affects their ability
for constraining $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$. We will further elaborate on this point
when we compare our results with staged simulations in section [TODO].

\subsection{Offset projection uncertainty of each cluster}
When we gather the offsets $\Delta s_{\rm KDE}'$ of the 
768 projections for each cluster,
we can find the offset uncertainty due to projection effects.
The distributed are illustrated in the box plot of Fig. 
\ref{fig:projected_KDE_offset_distribution}.

We use a robust statistic, the biweight mid-variance to characterize the spread
of the distribution instead of the standard deviation. The mid-variance can be
less susceptible to the effects of outliers.
Its definition is:
\begin{equation}
      C_{bl}= (n')^{1/2} \frac{[\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} (x_i-M)^2(1-u_i^2)^4]^{0.5}}
      {|\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} (1-u_i^2)(1-5u_i^2)|}
\end{equation}
where $u_i$ is 
\begin{equation}
		u_{i} = \frac{(x_i-M)}{c~MAD},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
   n' = \Sigma_{|u_i|<1}^n 1.
 \end{equation}
The $MAD$ is the median absolute deivation, $M$ is the median 
and $c$ is set to 9.0 as suggested by \cite{Beers90} and implemented by
\cite{astropy} as part of {\bf \texttt{astropy}}.

The biweight mid-variance of the $\Delta s_{\rm KDE}$ of half of the clusters
is $< 23$ kpc. Of the ten clusters (ID = 3, 7, 12, 20, 21, 32, 33, 37, 40 and 46) 
that have mid-variance $ > 40$ kpc, all of them have the median of $\nu > 1.2$
for that cluster.
 
\subsection{Correlations between different variables and the offsets}

We go through the list of physical quantities that have significant to little
correlation with the offsets. We describe the significance of the correlation 
based on the p-value reported by {\bf \texttt{Scipy}} of seeing the level of 
correlation by chance assuming the pair of 
quantities have no correlation. If the p-value is greater than 0.1, we call the
correlation as insignificant.

The two unrelaxedness criteria mentioned in section \ref{subsubsec:relaxedness}
both have significant positive correlation of $\sim 0.70$
with the maximum of $\Delta s_{\rm KDE}'$ of each cluster
(hereafter $\max(\Delta s_{\rm KDE}')$).
The offset $\max(\Delta s_{\rm KDE})$ per cluster also show a high
correlation of 0.77 with the median $\nu$ per cluster (hereafter,
median($\nu$)). The FoF mass of each cluster shows only slight correlation of 0.28 with 
 median($\nu$).

There is weak correlation between the richness of the
clusters with $\max(\Delta s_{\rm KDE})$ ($\rho = 0.21$). This weak correlation 
may be due to 
the fact that the peak estimate is only affected strongly by a few bright galaxies near 
the peak. The richness is slightly more strongly correlated with the median of $\nu$ 
with $\rho = 0.33$. 

There is insignificant negative correlation ($\rho = -0.20$) between the different mass 
measured within a certain density threshold, such as $M_{200C}$, $M_{500C}$, 
and $\max(\Delta s_{\rm KDE})$. The quantities $M_{200C}$ and $M_{500C}$, which
are computed within a shell centered on the most bound particles, have
symmetry assumptions that may not capture the total mass well if there are substructures. 
The FoF mass, which
captures the total mass without any symmetry assumption, correlates positively
and weakly 
($\rho = 0.13$) with $\max(\Delta s_{\rm KDE})$.

\section{DISCUSSION}\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Other findings from the visual inspection of the simulated galaxy clusters}
We inspected both the luminosity maps and the
number density maps of the member galaxy populations.
With the same selection of bright galaxies of apparent $i$-band$ < 24.4$ at
$z=0.3$, the luminosity maps in general resemble the DM maps more closely than 
the number density maps.
A comparison of the projected 
DM map, the luminosity map and the number density map of 129 clusters 
can be found at \href{https://goo.gl/kZUWrg}{https://goo.gl/kZUWrg}, 
\href{https://goo.gl/R7VNi9}{https://goo.gl/R7VNi9} and
\href{https://goo.gl/lmQUPd}{https://goo.gl/lmQUPd} respectively. (As
 the high resolution figures need to be downloaded, the 
corresponding Jupyter notebooks may take some time and several refresh of the
web page before they are rendered properly.)

In real observations, missing selection of member galaxies, or 
foreground objects can both affect the inference of the galaxy spatial 
distribution. The number density map can be less susceptible to bias from bright 
foreground objects. It is less clear about the effect of missing member galaxies 
for computing the luminosity map because there is a selection bias favoring 
bright member galaxies.

\subsection{Comparison to other observational studies}

\subsubsection{Comparing the Illustris data with merging cluster observations}

The offset distributions in table \ref{tab:p_val_table}
represent an estimation of the spread of $\Delta s$ in a $\Lambda$CDM universe.
While the compilation of the offset distribution suffers 
from the small number of high mass clusters in the Illustris simulation, 
the distribution probes projection uncertainties comprehensively. 
Possible discrepancies that affect our comparison can arise
due to the high purity and completeness of the Illustris data.
Most observations of massive galaxy clusters with total mass of M$_\odot
\approx 10^{14}$ have richness $\lesssim 300$, while the most massive Illustris
cluster (M$_{\rm FoF} = 3.23 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$) has a richness of 483.
Furthermore, the Illustris clusters are less massive than the observed clusters
with huge offsets. The Illustris clusters may also provide sufficient samples
of possible spatial configurations of observed clusters.
Despite the possible differences, we try to do a
fair comparison to observation by matching the method of offset inference. 

Other complications can arise from how one choose to subset the offset estimate
based on the cluster properties.
The full sample in table \ref{tab:p_val_table} preserves the cluster mass-abundance
relationship, i.e. each cluster has the same number of projections in
the full sample. However, it also underestimates the offset spread because the
full sample includes $\sim 45\%$ of relatively relaxed projections 
that only have one primary luminosity component.  These clusters would
have been excluded for comparison with bimodal mergers. 
Subsampling with $1.2 < \nu < 2.2$ picks out
cluster projections that are in more similar dynamical states as the merging
cluster observations. 
However, some simulated clusters may have more projections included in this sample
than the other clusters. From inspection of the mass abundance relations in 
Fig. \ref{fig:mass_abundance_distribution}, we found that subsampling with $1.2 <
\nu <2.2$ includes a higher proportion of projections from massive clusters
($\sim 20\%$ more) than 
the full sample. This sampling should not introduce significant bias. 
The actual merging clusters are still more massive than the unrelaxed samples. 

We compile table \ref{tab:offset_results} with the corresponding p-values using
the $\Delta y$ distributions of the unrelaxed samples ($1.2 < \nu < 2.2$). 
The p-values are reported base on the $\Delta y$ distribution from the same methods
that the observed values were computed. 
We make our best attempt to measure the $\Delta y_{\rm obs}$, the spatial component of the
observed offset along the axis connecting the subclusters if subcomponents exist.
In table \ref{tab:offset_results}, only Abell 3827 has one major distribution 
with four bright galaxy peaks due
to the 4 central giant elliptical galaxies of similar brightness. 
We also show $\Delta x_{\rm obs}$ components for comparison.
For most of the observed offsets, we obtain the estimates from the contour plots 
and descriptions of the corresponding papers. 
For the offsets that are roughly in line with the axis connecting the two subclusters,
we let $\Delta y = |\Delta {\bf s}|$. 
If $\Delta s_{\rm obs}$ is not aligned along the line joining the subclusters,
using $|\Delta s_{\rm obs}|$ instead of $\Delta y_{\rm obs}$ to come 
up with a p-value from the distribution of 
$\Delta y$ will lead to an artificial increase in significance.

The majority of the p-values from table \ref{tab:offset_results}, 13 out of 15, are
$ > 0.05$, only 2 p-values are below 0.05,  
meaning the observations are mainly consistent with the null hypothesis. 
If the accuracy of each observation are approximately the same, 
averaging the p-values can be one way of combining the p-values.
However, we must take caution in the procedure of interpreting p-values. 
It is inappropriate to keep on including observations to for calculating the
overall p-value without adjusting for the 
fact that the more data one takes, there is a higher chance of seeing 
an observation with extreme p-values.  
This is a commonly known pitfall of using p-value. 
To guard against such fluke, the particle physics community,
for example, discusses about stopping rules [TODO add reference]
for how to account for the sample size when the p-values are set {\it before}
analyzing the data. It is especially inappropriate to only report on 
a small number of p-values below 0.05 while most of the reported systems agree with 
the null hypothesis. We discuss more about possible ways to build on top of the results
of this study and improve the design of the 
analysis in section [TODO]. 

There are also possible differences in the accuracy of our peak
estimation method and those from the authors reporting the offsets. 
The population mid-variance of $\Delta y_{\rm KDE}$, which quantifies the
population bias from the DM peak estimation, is 23 kpc (the 68-th percentile is
$\pm$ 25 kpc).
We attribute the small amount of bias of the peaks of the luminosity KDE weighted
map from the DM peak to cross validation. Not only does the algorithm help
determine the width, but also the optimal orientation of the bandwidth matrix. 
Most literature do not discuss how the bandwidth of 
the kernel for their smoothed maps are determined.  
It is unclear if their results will enjoy the same accuracy level as what
we demonstrated. 
If scientists hand tune the smoothing bandwidth, it is hard to
avoid experimenter's preconception of how the cluster should look like. 

\subsubsection{Comparison of the offset results with other observational studies}
Our offset results are in general agreement with two other types of observational studies:
The first type are gravitational lensing studies that try to locate the DM peaks,  
the second type focuses on finding the best way to stack galaxy groups.
The BCG has the tightest offset from the DM peaks, centroid methods are
sensitive to substructures and have big uncertainties.

\cite{Oguri2010}


Without any priors,
many strong lensing studies (\cite{Zitrin2012}, \cite{Zitrin2012a}
and \cite{Mohammed2014}) have reported that the inferred strong lensing peak are in close
proximity to the BCGs. [TODO] quote how close the BCGs are to the peak locations. 
Many times, the bright galaxies are also the
central dominant (cD) galaxy with an extended, diffuse profile. 
The tight offset distribution from the BCG to the DM peak is also consistent with
the results from \cite{George2012a}.
The analysis of galaxy groups from \cite{George2012a} showed that
stacking based on the brightest galaxy member near the X-ray peak produces 
the highest lensing signal.
From table \ref{tab:offset_distributions}, $\Delta y_{\rm centroid}$ 
have the widest spreads among the offsets from the DM peaks. 
The large offset population variance from the DM peaks make the weighted 
centroid, which is a proxy of the center of mass, the least suitable 
if the goal of stacking is to maximize the overdensity in the stacked DM 
distribution. In \cite{George2012a}, lensing signal based clusters stacked on
the centroids are also shown to be weaker.  

For clusters with substructures, which are most of them, what the meaning of
the center of mass.

\section{Statistically inferring SIDM from a population of galaxy clusters} 

It is interesting to think of the implications of the large statistical 
uncertainties of $\Delta s$ for the inference of SIDM.

If SIDM gives a fixed offset signal for all clusters, then using more clusters
will increase the signal strength and lead to an excess for a certain offset. 
However, most SIDM particle interactions depend on the surface mass
density and the net velocity of motion among subclusters, even though the definition 

Directional lag - one such statistical test is called the Rayleigh z test  
However, dynamical friction, ram pressure slingshot have to test for both the
CDM and SIDM scenario with realistic distributions and numbers of member galaxies.  
If the snapshot duration is short enough
 one may track subhalos across snapshots to know confirm the
direction of motion  Subject of investigation of another paper 



- have to be account for the uncertainty of the actual merger
axis and the impact parameter  


With the large uncertainties from observation studies as shown by the offset
uncertainties in table \ref{tab:offset_distributions} and from fig. 

There are more statistical aspects that one need to consider before a rigorous
comparison can be 


The main implications of our results for inferring $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ from the
offset are the following.

There is no deterministic one-to-one mapping between $\Delta s$ and 
$\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.  
This result does not mean that $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ is always overestimated from
past literature. 
On the contrary, it means that individual SIDM offset estimate may either
experience a random increase or decrease due to the statistical noise of 
 the data and different offset inference methods have different sensitivity to 
 the noise.
If the offset signal from SIDM is small enough, the offset distribution may be
degenerate between different $\sigma_{SIDM}$ values.

Since SIDM is not the only source of contribution to the galaxy-DM offset 
in galaxy clusters,
any method for small number of clusters do not account for the intrinsic 
scatter will have unknown bias the estimate of $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$. 
This is because the statistcal scatter of $\Delta s$ may or may 
not align with the SIDM offset contribution. 

Need to sample enough galaxy clusters with the same selection criteria, 
both from simulations and from observations.

Asymmetry of DM map may not be statistically strong signal.
Different choice of the size of smoothing kernel and projection effects can both 
lead to spurious features such as tails in the convergence map.

In simulation

the selected observable of SIDM can discriminate between CDM and SIDM.

With the complications with analyzing galaxy clusters, 
it is not clear that finding SIDM with galaxy cluster is a tractable problem. 


\subsection{Significance of the intrinsic offset to inference of $\sigma_{\rm
SIDM}$}
Modeling a galaxy cluster is a high dimensional problem with missing
variables such as line-of-sight information and merging history which can all 
lead to large uncertainties.

It is hard to define an analog for observed galaxy clusters due to missing
information such as projection, merger history which may not be described well
by parametric representation.

Given the uncertainties purely due to offset estimation methods and 
intrinsic scatter of $\Delta s$, any estimates of $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ without
account for these uncertainties will overestimate.

\section{Future research direction}
The data in the Illustris simulation has proven to be an excellent source of
understanding observational uncertainties.
Further work can be done to make mock observations more realistic, including:
\begin{itemize}
		\item adding foreground structures 
		\item examining the effects of incompleteness removing some member galaxies randomly 
		\item computing the velocity dispersion of the galaxies along different
			line-of-sight to see how the velocity dispersion correlates the different
			measures of unrelaxedness
		\item testing for identifying member galaxies using the red sequence
	\end{itemize}


\section{SUMMARY}
We showed that 
\begin{itemize}
		\item there is not enough evidence 
			 to reject the null hypothesis of
			seeing $\Delta s$ as extreme as those in observed merging galaxy clusters assuming that
			$\Lambda$CDM is the true underlying physical model  \\

		\item the contribution of statistical uncertainty to the galaxy-DM offsets 
			for $\Lambda$CDM clusters is not negligible when compared to the reported
			levels of offset from staged simulations ($\sim 50$ kpc). Any
			observational study that uses 
			galaxy-DM offsets to
			constrain $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ has to account for this contribution
			or else $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ will be biased. \\

		\item while the location estimates of the 2D spatial distribution of offsets and the
			1D spatial distributions of the offsets ($\Delta y$) in the Illustris
			simulation are approximately zero.
			The root-mean-square of the magnitude of the
			offsets is $\sim 30$ kpc from the Illustris sample. 
			If one uses the magnitude of the offset to constrain
			$\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$, $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 0$ 
			does not map to zero magnitude of offset.  
			The converse may also not be true but needs to be verify by a
			cosmological simulation with realistic galaxy distribution and SIDM. 
			\\

		\item with high completeness and purity of member galaxy data, the
			luminosity map resembles the DM spatial distribution more closely than 
			the number density map of member galaxies. \\ 

		\item the locations of the most gravitationally bound particle are consistent 
			with the BCG for systems with little substructures.  \\

		\item the BCG has the smallest offset to the dominant DM peak; and  
			the KDE peak of the luminosity map gives the second tightest 
			offsets from the DM peak. \\

		\item there are offset observations in the Illustris simulation that are as
			extreme as the offset observed in more massive merging galaxy clusters. 
			

		% \item the resolution of the DM distribution can affect
		% 	individual estimates $\Delta s$ but do not show significant bias for
		% 	the population estimate. However, the lower the resolution, the higher
		% 	the variance of the population estimate.
