\section{INTRODUCTION} 
During the latest stage of structure formation, the universe gave birth to
non-linear, hierarchical structures known as galaxy clusters. 
These clusters, made up of dark matter, galaxies and hot gas,
are constantly accreting, merging and evolving with their
environments. Bright galaxies that belong to a galaxy cluster or group, in 
particular, highlight the overdensities of the underlying dark matter (DM) 
distribution. 

% Peaks, summary statistics 
% Modeling galaxy clusters - distributions, peaks, centroids 

In these high density regions of the clusters, the rates of particle
interactions can be enhanced, including the long-suspected self-interaction of DM
particles (hereafter, SIDM). 
Many papers have used the DM density peaks to give constraints on 
the self-interaction cross
sections of dark matter (\citealt{Markevitch2004}, \citealt{Bradac2006b}, Mertel , Dawson, Jee etc.). 

% Why we want to compare galaxies with the DM distribution? 

% What are the observational methods for summarizing dark matter distribution?
Weak and strong lensing are the most reliable methods for mapping the dark 
matter distribution in a galaxy cluster. 
Common to all the methods are the estimation of the density peaks. 


% What are the methods for summarizing the galaxy distribution?



We quantify the bias and uncertainty associated with the one-point summary
statistic for summarizing the physical state of a galaxy cluster. 
Commonly used one-point statistic of galaxy clusters include:
1) centroid and its variants with the data weighted by various mass proxies, 
2) luminosity peaks (\citep{Robertson2016}, Dawson blah), 
3) galaxy number density peaks,
4) the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) etc.
For each cluster, these quantities do not necessarily coincide, 
especially when there is asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the galaxy 
cluster components. 

Offsets between different statistical measures of the galaxy and the DM
population are not going to be zero.
% Miscentering ?! want to capture the dominant component of the cluster 
% You only have one center when there is only ONE component 

Uncertainties affect the conclusion for the computation the hypothesis test / parameter
estimation
Previous work on quantifying galaxy-DM offsets included  
What centroids they have used

Physical motivation for using the galaxy density peak 
Observation footprints 

Under the assumed Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, it is unclear 
that how large the offset $\Delta \vec{s}$ should be. 
% Why use simulation data to study the populations? 
Other complications for studying galaxy clusters arise from observation
limitations. There is not a lot of information that can help constrain the  
line-of-sight distance of different components of a cluster. 


% Goals of the paper
With the advent of large-scale sky surveys, 
the number of identified galaxy clusters is growing quickly. 
Existing catalogs such as the Abell catalog also contain
peaks inferred
from the different peak finding methods and the DM peaks. 
at least 4000 clusters with at least 30 members. 
The future Large Synoptic Sky Survey alone will identify over a hundred thousand galaxy
clusters (CITE). It is important to verify the uncertainties associated with common
summary statistics for studying galaxy clusters. Considering the large quantity
of data, methods with manual tuning will not scale well. The manual biases may
also make it hard to 
obtain consistent statistics from the samples.

In this paper, we 
1) extract realistic observables from the Illustris simulation for
comparison with observations, 2) explore the pros and cons of the different statistic for 
summarizing {\it the member galaxy population} of a galaxy cluster, 3)	
give estimates for the offsets between the summary statistics of the galaxy  
population and the DM population under $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, which we call 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta s \equiv \vec{s}_{\rm gal} - \vec{s}_{\rm DM}.
\end{equation}
where $\bf{s}_{gal}$ and $\bf{s}_{DM}$ are the two-dimensional (2D) spatial
locations of the summary statistic of the galaxy population, and the density
peak of DM respectively and 4) examine the reasons for outliers in 
the offset distribution and investigate the  
correlations between the 3-dimensional properties of a cluster and the projected 
observables such as $\Delta s_{\rm proj}$.

		we assume a cosmological redshift
of $z=0.3$, as shown by the richness cut. A total of 43 clusters have 
survived this cut. \label{fig:mass_richness}}

% Basic setup 
The organization of this paper is as follows:
In section \ref{sec:illustris_sim}, we will describe the physical properties of 
the products of the Illustris
simulation (\citealt{Vogelsberger2014}, \citealt{Genel2014a}), 
and the selection criteria that we have employed to ensure that the
quantities that we examine resemble observables but without noise and
systematics from observations. 
Then in section \ref{sec:methods}, 
we will describe the methods for computing various 
one-point statistics of the spatial distribution of galaxies how we prepare our dark
matter spatial data to resemble convergence maps. We will show the comparison
of the different summary statistics before we show the main results
in section \ref{sec:results}. Finally, we will discuss the implications of our
results and compare it to other simulations and observations.

	Our analysis makes use of the same flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology
as the Illustris simulation. The relevant cosmological parameters are
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7274, \Omega_m = 0.2726$, and $H_0 = 70.4$
km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$.

\section{THE ILLUSTRIS SIMULATION DATA} 
\label{sec:illustris_sim}
The Illustris simulation that we made use of contains some of the most
realistic, simulated galaxies to date, making it especially suitable for 
verifying the assumed properties of galaxy clusters. We obtained our data from 
snapshot number 135 (cosmological $z=0$) of the Illustris-1 simulation . The Illustris-1
simulation has the highest particle resolution and has incorporated the most 
comprehensive baryonic physics among the different Illustris simulation suites. 
The sophisticated galaxy formation model in Illustris-1 
 includes star formation rate, stellar evolution due to
environmental effects and supernovae feedback etc. The physics of stellar
evolution were solved using a moving mesh code {\bf \texttt{AREPO}} \citep{Springel2010}.
This simulation formalism accounts for the environment effects of a cluster to the
evolution of galaxies. The galaxies were statistically consistent
with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data
\citet{Vogelsberger2014}. Since the profile of the galaxies clusters were not
provided in symmetrical parametric forms, we can study 
how asymmetry in the cluster profile affects the estimate of our summary 
statistic. This data allows us to examine cluster galaxies
in a realistic, yet noise-free way.

The two sets of data catalogs in use are obtained through two types of halo
finders. The catalog that maps particles to the halo of a certain cluster was 
created by the {\bf \texttt{Subfind}} algorithm. The friends-of-friends (FoF) 
finder (CITE properly: Davis et al. 1985) was further used to identify the affinity
of galaxy-sized halos to a galaxy-cluster. 
These galaxy-size halos are also referred to as {\it subhalos}. These
subhalos are the dark matter host of what we refer to as galaxies in Illustris-1. 



\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig2_color_magnitude_diagram9.eps}
	\caption{Color-magnitude diagram of one of the galaxy clusters that is selected for 
		analysis. This cluster is the 9th most massive. 
		The apparent magnitude is calculated assuming that 
		the cosmological redshift (distance) is $z = 0.3$. 
		We can see a clear overdense region that corresponds to a red-sequence.
		The color-magnitude diagrams of the other clusters can be found in the
		Jupyter notebook at \href{https://github.com/karenyyng/galaxy_DM_offset/blob/master/code/analyses/fig2_color_magnitude_diagram.ipynb}{https://goo.gl/TJmI6s}.
		\label{fig:color_magnitude_diagram}
	} 
\end{figure}
For our results, we make use of galaxy clusters / groups 
that have at least 50 member galaxies after this magnitude cut in the $i$ band. 
This is because of the relatively large statistical uncertainty from if we try
to analyze clusters with less than 50 member galaxies. 



% LSST goes as deep as 27.5

\subsubsection{Cluster properties}
\label{subsubsec:cluster_properties}

\subsection{Relaxedness of the clusters}

Clusters undergo merger activities in the time scale of million of years. 
Observations can only provide snapshots of the state of a cluster. 
This info is also hard to retrieve from simulations across different saved
states.
We quantify the state of the cluster by providing several quantitative
definitions of non-relaxedness and see how they correlate with $\Delta s$.
Some definitions of non-relaxedness referred by the simulation community
include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ratio of mass outside the dominant dark matter halo over the total mass
		of the galaxy cluster 
	\item distance between the most bound particle from the center of mass as a
		function of $R_{200c}$.
\end{itemize}
While we try to provide more observation oriented quantities as we would
discuss in the method section \ref{subsubsec:KDE}. 


\subsection{Selection of the field-of-view}
\label{sec:FOV}

\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{180mm} 
	\caption{ Selection criteria for stellar subhalos (member galaxies) for each
		cluster / group 
\label{tab:member_galaxy_selections}} 
	\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\hline 
Data &  Selection strategy  & Sensitivity & Relevant section  \\ \hline
Field of view (FOV) & FoF halo finder& comparable to FOV of the Subaru
Suprime camera &   \\ 
Observed filter & $i$-band & consistent over the redder $r, i, z$ bands &   \\ 
Cluster richness  & $i \leq 24.4$ and $z = 0.3$  & sensitive to
the assumed cosmological redshift of cluster and &    \\ 
& & the assumed limiting magnitude of telescope &   \\

discussed as results  & \\  
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:selection_criteria} 
\footnotesize{
}
\end{minipage}
\end{center} 
\end{table*}

As a default output from the Illustris simulation, subhalos and particles of
each galaxy cluster and group are identified by the halo finder
(CITE). We make use of the member particle / subhalo identification as our
default volume selection scheme for each cluster / group.
We understand that this choice of volume selection can be more ideal than
observational conditions. We make use of this volume selection scheme
for baseline comparisons. 

Furthermore, assuming a conservative line-of-sight (los) distance 
, i.e. cosmological redshift, of [TODO] $z = 0.4$, 
the projected extent for most of the Illustris galaxy clusters and groups, 
fits inside the field of view of telescopes, such as the Subaru Suprime Camera,
which covers a physical area of [TODO] $\sim 9$ Mpc $\times 7$ Mpc. 
(See \href{https://goo.gl/ClZNvM}{https://goo.gl/ClZNvM} for a Jupyter notebook 
showing the extent of the Dark Matter distribution of the most massive 129 clusters)


% Halo and FoF finding is described in \citep{Vogelsberger2014}.

\subsubsection{Spatial Projections}
The summary statistics are computed all based on 2D matter projections of the
spatial location.
In order to represent the projection uncertainty, we sample the projections evenly
by using HealPy (CITE), which is a Python wrapper for HealPix (CITE).
The viewing angles of the projections are defined by an elevation angle
$\xi$ and an azimuthal angle $\phi$. 
The number of projections that we employed is 384 for each cluster.

\subsection{Properties of the galaxies in Illustris clusters}
\subsubsection{Galaxy weights}
\label{subsubsec:galaxy_weights}

Not all galaxies are created equal, so they should not be considered with equal
importance for peak identification, which requires summing the
the mass proxy of different galaxies. 
Galaxies reside in host halos with different masses and 
contain different stellar masses. The brightness of galaxies in a cluster are 
also affected by the cluster environments.
For example, the star formation rates of cluster galaxies are known to be 
suppressed by the high concentration of intracluster medium. (CITE)
One of the most common weighting schemes employed for galaxy data is to weight
by the luminosity in a particular band.
We make use of the available mock observables in the Illustris data, including 
the $u, g, r, i, z$ band absolute magnitude associated with each subhalo. 
[TODO] Discuss Fig. \ref{fig:color_magnitude_diagram} and the red sequence.



\section{METHODS}\label{sec:methods}

There are many reasonable models for summarizing the overall spatial
distribution of cluster components. Each method has different uncertainties.
Our goal here is   
not to identify galaxies as parts of subcluster components,
but to find the location where we expect to see the highest mass density of the
DM. We want to probe the region of the highest density, as a baseline for
comparisons to simulations with DM self-interaction. 
Reasonable spatial models of cluster components 
fall under several categories, 1) mixture models, 2) basis function
expansions, such as wavelet methods \citep{Jauzac2014} and 3) non-parametric estimations 
such as a kernel density estimation, or hierarchical clustering. 
Not only do the performance of the 
first two methods depend heavily on model parameters such as characteristic 
scales, 
the data fit also depend quite strongly on the functional form of 
the underlying mixture model / wavelet basis. Often times, 
the mixture models and wavelet bases 
carry strong symmetry assumptions that may not be valid for spatial modeling of 
hierarchically formed galaxy clusters that have more than one important physical 
length scale. 
This is because galaxy clusters have substructures over a wide range of length
scales, from galaxy scales of hundreds of pc to fraction of a Mpc. 
The symmetry assumption will bias the estimate of the point estimate that we
are after for non-symmetric clusters.
We explain the well known bias-variance tradeoff in appendix \ref{ap:}for unfamiliar
readers.


Goal: to identify the ``center'' of the light distribution. Here the adopted 
tracers for the light distribution are the member galaxies of the cluster 
and groups.

We do not claim that point estimates are sufficient statistics for
best representing the physical states of galaxy clusters nor the effect of
self-interacting dark matter. However, we try to understand the impact of the
different choices of point estimates on the estimate of $\Delta s$. 
We compare four ways to identify the light/galaxy centers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Centroids
\item KDE with peak finder
\item Shrinking aperture method
\item Brightest cluster galaxy (BCG)

\end{enumerate}
We avoid any manual methods for identifying peaks for
comparison purposes, scalability and reproducibility, 
which is a key property of science. 
Since all the methods listed in this
paper are automated with the source code openly available, 
it is possible for future studies to reuse our code for comparisons. 
There are a number of decisions ($\sim $[TODO] ADD NUMBER) that one needs to make to 
determine the summary statistics. We will try to address the sensitivity of the offset
due to each decision. 
Furthermore, a major advantage for automation is that it allows us  
to scale up our analysis by applying
the same methods across the different snapshots of the (Illustris) simulations to
examine the variability of $\Delta s$ across time. 


\subsubsection{Computing the weighted centroid}
\label{Unweighted}
We follow the usual definition of spatial centroid as 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\bf x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \vec{x}_i. 
\end{equation}
While the weighted centroids are just: 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\bf x}_w = \frac{\sum_i w_i \vec{x}_i}{\sum_i w_i},
\end{equation}
with $\vec{x}_i$ being the positional vector of each subhalo 
and we use the $i$-band luminosity 
as the weight $w_i$ for the $i$-th galaxy.
Centroids can be biased 1) by subcomponents from merging activities yet the
centroid estimate do not provide explicit evidence for ongoing merger or 
accretion. These estimates are also sensitive to odd boundaries 
of the field of view.

\subsubsection{Cross-validated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the peak finder} 
\label{subsubsec:KDE}
We employed a KDE algorithm to infer a smooth density distribution of the
sparse galaxies.
It is known that the choice of the functional form of the smoothing kernel does
not dominate the density estimate $\hat{f}$ as long as the chosen kernel is
smooth (CITE). Instead we focus our effort to use cross-validation to obtain 
the optimal 2D smoothing
bandwidth matrix for each cluster ($\Hmat$) for our 2D Gaussian kernel. 
\begin{align}
	\hat{f}(\chi; \Hmat) &= \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}|\Hmat|^{1/2}}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \exp((\chi-{\bf x}_i)^T H^{-1} (\chi-{\bf x}_i)),
\end{align}
where the dimensionality is $d=2$ for our projected quantities,
$\chi$ represents the uniform grid points for evaluation, and 
$\bf{x}_i$ contains the spatial coordinates for each of the identified member 
galaxies that survived our brightness cut.

Specifically, we made use of the KDE function in
the statistical package {\bf \texttt{ks}} (CITE Duong) in the R statistical 
computing environment (CITE R Core Team 2014). 
Cross validation eliminates free parameters in the KDE and minimizes
the asymptotic mean-integrated squared error (AMISE) for a best fit to the
data. Although the smoothed cross validation technique takes $O(n^3)$
(DOUBLECHECK) computational requirement, the number of cluster galaxies are
small enough for this method to finish quickly. 

After obtaining the KDE estimate, we employed both a first and second-order  
finite differencing algorithm to find the local maxima.  
The local maxima were then sorted according to the KDE density in a descending
fashion before we perform peak matching. 

The spatial location and the density of the subdominant peaks are also stored.
The density
of the peaks are normalized as a fraction of the densest peak for each
projection of each cluster in our sample. 
We investigated if the presence of subdominant peaks are correlated with
$\Delta s$. 

 we provide scientifically accurate contours from the KDE 
estimates from the cross-validated KDE method. 


\subsubsection{Shrinking aperture estimates}
Another popular method among astronomers for finding the peak of a spatial
distribution is what we call the shrinking aperture method.
While we do not endorse this method,
we test if the shrinking aperture method is able to reliably recover the 
densest peak.
This method is dependent on the initial diameter and the initial center 
location of the aperture.
This method does not evaluate if the cluster is made up of
several components.
The estimate using the shrinking aperture algorithm can be biased by
substructures. The only way to inform the algorithm about substructures would
be to introduce another parameter to restrict the center of the aperture, or to
partition the data with another algorithm.
Furthermore, the convergence rate for this iterative algorithm is not
analytical and is dependent on the data and the parameters. We present the
convergence criteria for reference. 
We note that the exact implementation may result in different statistical 
performance.  
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Shrinking aperture algorithm. See code at
		\href{https://goo.gl/nqxJl8}{https://goo.gl/nqxJl8}.

	\KwData{subhalo that satisfy cuts as a galaxy}

	 initial aperture centroid = mean galaxy location in each spatial dimension\\
 	distance array = euclidean distances between initial aperture center and each galaxy
	location \\
 	aperture radius = 90th percentile of the distance array\\ 
	\While{ (newCenterDist - oldCenterDist) / oldCenterDist $\geq$ 2e-2}{
 		new data array = old data array within aperture\\
 		newCenter = mean value of new data along each spatial dimension 
	}   \hrulefill
 \end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG)}
The BCGs are formed by the merger of many smaller
galaxies. The galaxy-cannibalism makes BCGs typically brighter than the rest 
the cluster galaxy population by several orders of magnitude. (CITE?)
However, star formation can result
in galaxies brighter in the bluer photometric bands.
To avoid star formation from biasing our algorithm for identifying the
BCG, we find at the brightest galaxies in redder bands i.e. the $r, i, z$
bands and found that they give consistent results for all selected clusters. 
The band that we used to pick the BCG for presentation and the final results 
is the $i$-band.

	\caption{Comparison of peak finding performances of different methods by
		drawing data points (i.e. 20, 50, 100, 500) from known number of

		panels from the middle row contain data from two

	performed the analyses [TODO: state how many times] many times to

	zoomed-in view of the data in the middle
	column. The rightmost column shows how the size (median contour radius) 
	of the confidence regions vary as a
	function of the number of drawn data points from the Gaussian mixtures.

	column, we can tell that the KDE peak estimate is the most accurate but less
	precise for estimating the sampled data from each set of data. 
		\label{fig:toy_data_mixtures}}
\end{figure*}



\subsection{Comparison of the methods from test data}
In order to examine the statistical properties of commonly used point-
estimates of the distribution of the galaxy data, we test them on data drawn 
from Gaussian mixtures with known mean and variance. (See Fig.
\ref{fig:toy_data_mixtures}). The main factors that affect the performance of 
the methods are sensitive to the statistical fluctuations of the drawn data, 
e.g. the
spatial distribution of the data, including 1) the density profile and 2) the
location(s) of subdominant mixtures,
, and 3) the number of data points that we draw.
It is also not enough to just
compare the performance by applying each method for one realization of the
data. We provide the 68\% and the 95\% confidence regions by applying the
each method for many Monte Carlo realizations.
In general, the peaks identified from the KDE density is closer to the 
peak of the dominant mixture (more accurate) than 
both the weighted centroid method and the shrinking aperture method.
For example, in the bottom middle panel, it is clear that the green contours
that represents the confidence region for the shrinking aperture peak is
biased due to the substructure, whereas the confidence region for the centroid 
is so biased that it is
outside the field of view of that panel.
For the bottom right plot, there is also a catastrophic outlier for the shrinking 
aperture method for 500 data
points. The outlier shows how the shrinking aperture method can have
radical behavior when there are subclusters in the data.	

\subsection{Modeling the DM map in Illustris-1 and the lensing kernel}
The most established method of inferring the projected dark matter spatial 
distribution from observations is through gravitational lensing.
It works by detecting subtle image distortions of background galaxies due to
the foreground dark matter. The resolution of the inferred map therefore 
depends on the properties of the galaxies, such as the projected number density, 
intrinsic ellipticities and morphology etc.
To achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for lensing, 
\citealt{Hoag2016}  has performed simulation for inferring the optimal size
for a Gaussian smoothing kernel. 
In the strong lensing regime, Hoag et al. found a resolution of 11 arcseconds
can best maximize the fit. This kernel translates to a physical size of 50 
kpc assuming a cosmological redshift of $z = 0.3$.
To infer the 2D projected density from Illustris-1, 
we constructed (smoothed) histograms of the DM
particles of each selected galaxy cluster. 
Physically, the 2D histogram of the dark matter of each cluster 
is analogous to a convergence map from a lensing analysis. 
% We show results after convolving the histograms with .   

% - [  ] Add the equation calculating a lensing kernel due to S/N constraint 
% apropos conversation with Marusa and Austin 's 


% \subsection{Smoothness of the dark matter distribution}
% From the plots with peak identification, it can be shown in Fig.
% \ref{fig:select_peak_visualization} that most clusters are
% multiply peaked. The actual location of these peaks also depend sensitively 
% on the lensing kernel size and the exact reconstruction method.  
% While it is not the goal of this work to investigate which DM mass-distribution
% reconstruction methodis the best, we try to match the resolution of the DM 
% analyses for our final results.

[TODO] cite papers that find DM peaks!
\subsection{Finding the offsets and its population distributions} 
We computed the projected offsets between the galaxy population and the DM
populations of each cluster using different summary statistic.  


\subsubsection{Peak matching}

\subsubsection{Possible populations of galaxy clusters}
Furthermore, to avoid undesirable effects from setting hard boundary at offset
= 0 when plotting the PDF of the offsets, we randomly assign the sign of an
offset before smoothing the PDF. Finally, after smoothing the PDF, we take the
absolute magnitude of the offset as a comparison of how taking absolute
magnitude affects our estimates. We provide the best estimate of the offset
using the biweight statistic [CITE].

From Fig. \ref{fig:offset_distributions}, we can tell that the population

\item explain the variation of the offsets for the same cluster under different 
projections 
\end{itemize}

While there is a tight distribution for $\Delta s_{BCG}$ that peaks around
zero, there are a non-negligible population of data points that lie outside
this peak. 

\subsection{Possible causes of the offsets}
We subset the data and visually inspected the samples with the largest galaxy-DM
offsets $\Delta s_{\rm KDE}$. We found that ...

\item richness

\section{DISCUSSION}\label{sec:discussion}
It is not easy to compare the result of this study to other study due to the 
differences in the multi-step method for inferring the "peak", or the
"centroid".

\subsection{Other findings from the visual inspection of the simulated galaxy clusters}
From the high resolution visualization of the DM maps (two-dimensional
histograms with 2 kpc bins) in 
Fig. \ref{fig:select_peak_visualization}, we can tell that some clusters clearly
possess multiple subclusters with visible separations between the subclusters, e.g. cluster 12 visualized on the panels on row 3 
of the plot. 
However, there are also many clusters that contain  
only one main component, or several closely packed components as indicated by
several significant peaks. 
This illustrates why finding a `center' or peak of a cluster is an ill-defined 
notion. These statistics are only unambiguous for symmetric, relaxed 
clusters.  

Furthermore, we show a lower-resolution visualization of the DM surface
map in Fig. [TODO] compared to the higher resolution map, we can see a clear
shift in the peak location. This illustrates that peak / center finding is also
subject to noise from the data.

\subsection{Comparison to other simulations}
\subsubsection{Estimation of the SIDM cross section from the Illustris offsets}
Since the Illustris simulation assumes CDM, it is interesting to see if we can
infer any non-zero $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ from the offset estimates based on
different methods.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item compare to the Eagle simulation. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison to other observational studies}
Central galaxy paradigm (CGP)
\begin{itemize}
		\item cite Jes Ford's paper about miscentering in CFHT and the difference between
			taking the absolute magnitude of an offset or not 
	\end{itemize}


% As there are no well-established procedure for summarizing the peak or the
% center of a cluster, nor there is a good m 
There are many aspects of the analysis that is not covered by this study that
are performed for analyzing observational data, such as 

\begin{itemize}
		\item galaxy membership identification along the line of sight
		\item removal of foreground galaxies  
	\end{itemize}
	that are important for calculating the $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ with using a
	galaxy-DM offset.

\section{SUMMARY}
We have provided a set of python functions for making accurate contour levels
for spatial maps and inferring density peaks at 
\href{https://goo.gl/MNrSQV}{https://goo.gl/MNrSQV}.
We showed that 
\begin{itemize}
		\item  the peak finding method from KDE for the density of cluster
			galaxies is the second least biased due to substructures from our test data. 
		\item  
		\item  all existing peak finding methods have non-negligible uncertainty 
			due to the small number of data points. When dealing with small number of
			cluster samples, the uncertainties of the peak locations should not be
			ignored.
		\item the resolution of the DM distribution can affect
			individual estimates $\Delta s$ but do not show significant bias for
			the population estimate. However, the lower the resolution, the higher
			the variance of the population estimate.  
		% \item the large and tedious number of decisions that goes into computing 
		% 	the offsets
		% 	from simulations make it hard if not impossible for comparison between 
		% 	studies. 
		% 	We call researchers in this field to make their software and analysis 
		% 	code openly available.
		% \item a proper Bayesian analysis should be performed between a set of
		% 	simulation with and without a detectable $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ to verify
		% 	which statistic would be sufficient to capture  
\end{itemize}
While this paper does not provide a solution to the complete statistical model
for galaxy clusters, it points out some of the aspects that good models should
incorporate, especially when the utility of studying the cluster is to
constrain $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.

Aspects that should be handle with care include:
\begin{itemize}
		\item the mass profile, especially when the cluster is multimodal 
		\item the evaluation of galaxy membership and the corresponding luminosity
			peak(s)
	\end{itemize}
