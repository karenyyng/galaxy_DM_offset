abstract = {We present an overview of galaxy evolution across cosmic time in the Illustris Simulation. Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2*1820{\^{}}3 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc){\^{}}3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z=0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z=0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star-formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z=5 to z=0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in HST mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z=2 to their z=0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z=0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star-formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {Recent simulations have indicated that the dark matter halos of galaxy clusters should feature steep density jumps near the virial radius. Since the member galaxies are expected to follow similar collisionless dynamics as the dark matter, the galaxy density profile should show such a feature as well. We examine the potential of current datasets to test this prediction by selecting cluster members for a sample of 56 low-redshift (0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.3) galaxy clusters, constructing their projected number density profiles, and fitting them with two profiles, one with a steep density jump and one without. Additionally, we investigate the presence of a jump using a non-parametric spline approach. We find that some of these clusters show strong evidence for a model with a density jump. We discuss avenues for further analysis of the density jump with future datasets.},

abstract = {Using a large N-body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation, we study the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc){\^{}}3 in a LCDM universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 1.1x10{\^{}}12 Msun, including 18 massive clusters with M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun. It also contains 1 088 797 galaxies with mass M{\_}gal {\textgreater} 2x10{\^{}}9 Msun and luminosity L {\textgreater} 9.5x10{\^{}}5 Lsun. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then computed the fraction f{\_}BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio Dv/s, where Dv is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster, and s is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. f{\_}BNC increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M{\_}cl {\~{}} 10{\^{}}12 Msun) to 0.5 for high-mass ones (M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun), with no dependence on cluster redshift. The values of Dv/s vary from 0 to 1.8. These results are consistent with previous observational studies, and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. Analysis of the merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation reveals that 16 of these clusters have experienced major mergers in the past. These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merger of smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed.},

abstract = {Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the 'cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5 megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the 'metal' and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing magnification is measured with a significance of 9.7$\sigma$ on a large sample of galaxy clusters in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). This survey covers ˜154 deg2 and contains over 18 000 cluster candidates at redshifts 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.9, detected using the 3D-Matched Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al. We fit composite-NFW models to the ensemble, accounting for cluster miscentring, source-lens redshift overlap, as well as nearby structure (the two-halo term), and recover mass estimates of the cluster dark matter haloes in range of ˜1013 M⊙ to 2 × 1014 M⊙. Cluster richness is measured for the entire sample, and we bin the clusters according to both richness and redshift. A mass-richness relation M200 = M0(N200/20)$\beta$ is fit to the measurements. For two different cluster miscentring models, we find consistent results for the normalization and slope, M0 = (2.3 ± 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, $\beta$ = 1.4 ± 0.1 and M0 = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, $\beta$ = 1.5 ± 0.1. We find that accounting for the full redshift distribution of lenses and sources is important, since any overlap can have an impact on mass estimates inferred from flux magnification.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxies with redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formation rates than field populations remains an important problem. As most candidate processes ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations of the local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a range in halo mass and redshift, are needed. In this work, we present and test a rigorous, probabilistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based on precise photometric redshifts and X-ray-selected groups drawn from the COSMOS field. The groups have masses in the range 1013 {\textless}{\~{}} M 200c/M ⊙ {\textless}{\~{}} 1014 and span redshifts 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. We characterize our selection algorithm via tests on spectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the Very Large Telescope, and by applying our method to detailed mock catalogs. We find that our group member galaxy sample has a purity of 84{\%} and completeness of 92{\%} within 0.5{\{}R{\_}{\{}200c{\}}{\}}. We measure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on the quality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as well as future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. As a first application of our new group member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that member galaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixed stellar mass out to z {\~{}} 1, indicating a significant relationship between star formation and environment at group scales. We also address the suggestion that dusty star-forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannot explain the low power seen in recent Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements.},

@article{Markevitch2004,
abstract = {We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E0657-56, a cluster with a rare, high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, sigma/m{\textless}1 cm{\^{}}2/g, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm{\^{}}2/g interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate which involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.},

abstract = {The galaxy cluster 1E0657-56 (z = 0.296) is remarkably well-suited for addressing outstanding issues in both galaxy evolution and fundamental physics. We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution from both strong and weak gravitational lensing data. Multi-color, high-resolution HST ACS images allow detection of many more arc candidates than were previously known, especially around the subcluster. Using the known redshift of one of the multiply imaged systems, we determine the remaining source redshifts using the predictive power of the strong lens model. Combining this information with shape measurements of "weakly" lensed sources, we derive a high-resolution, absolutely-calibrated mass map, using no assumptions regarding the physical properties of the underlying cluster potential. This map provides the best available quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster. We also confirm the result from Clowe et al. (2004,2006a).},

abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56 (the Bullet Cluster), including the effects of elastic dark matter scattering. In a similar manner to the stripping of gas by ram pressure, dark matter self-interactions would transfer momentum between the two galaxy cluster dark matter haloes, causing them to lag behind the collisionless galaxies. The absence of an observed separation between the dark matter and stellar components in the Bullet Cluster has been used to place upper limits on the cross-section for dark matter scattering. We emphasise the importance of analysing simulations in an observationally-motivated manner, finding that the way in which the positions of the various components are measured can have a larger impact on derived constraints on dark matter's self-interaction cross-section than reasonable changes to the initial conditions for the merger. In particular, we find that the methods used in previous studies to place some of the tightest constraints on this cross-section do not reflect what is done observationally, and overstate the Bullet Cluster's ability to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. We introduce the first simulations of the Bullet Cluster including both self-interacting dark matter and gas. We find that as the gas is stripped it introduces radially-dependent asymmetries into the stellar and dark matter distributions. As the techniques used to determine the positions of the dark matter and galaxies are sensitive to different radial scales, these asymmetries can lead to erroneously measured offsets between dark matter and galaxies even when they are spatially coincident.},

@article{George2012a,
abstract = {Locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding the mass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massive galaxies that they host. The task is observationally challenging because we cannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or X-ray emission from hot plasma are imperfect. In this paper we quantify the consequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129 X-ray selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field with redshifts 0{\textless}z{\textless}1 and halo masses in the range 10 13 - 10 14 Msun. By measuring the stacked lensing signal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest member galaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the X-ray centroid), we determine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. In this sample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the X-ray centroids trace the center of mass to {\textless}{\~{}}75 kpc, while the X-ray position and centroids based on the mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to the statistical uncertainties in their positions (typically {\~{}}50-150 kpc). Approximately 30{\%} of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiple bright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles that are not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems. We find halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by 5-30{\%} if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is not addressed.},
