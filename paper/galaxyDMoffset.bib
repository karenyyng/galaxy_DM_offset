abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56 (the Bullet Cluster), including the effects of elastic dark matter scattering. In a similar manner to the stripping of gas by ram pressure, dark matter self-interactions would transfer momentum between the two galaxy cluster dark matter haloes, causing them to lag behind the collisionless galaxies. The absence of an observed separation between the dark matter and stellar components in the Bullet Cluster has been used to place upper limits on the cross-section for dark matter scattering. We emphasise the importance of analysing simulations in an observationally-motivated manner, finding that the way in which the positions of the various components are measured can have a larger impact on derived constraints on dark matter's self-interaction cross-section than reasonable changes to the initial conditions for the merger. In particular, we find that the methods used in previous studies to place some of the tightest constraints on this cross-section do not reflect what is done observationally, and overstate the Bullet Cluster's ability to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. We introduce the first simulations of the Bullet Cluster including both self-interacting dark matter and gas. We find that as the gas is stripped it introduces radially-dependent asymmetries into the stellar and dark matter distributions. As the techniques used to determine the positions of the dark matter and galaxies are sensitive to different radial scales, these asymmetries can lead to erroneously measured offsets between dark matter and galaxies even when they are spatially coincident.},

abstract = {Locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding the mass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massive galaxies that they host. The task is observationally challenging because we cannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or X-ray emission from hot plasma are imperfect. In this paper we quantify the consequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129 X-ray selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field with redshifts 0{\textless}z{\textless}1 and halo masses in the range 10 13 - 10 14 Msun. By measuring the stacked lensing signal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest member galaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the X-ray centroid), we determine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. In this sample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the X-ray centroids trace the center of mass to {\textless}{\~{}}75 kpc, while the X-ray position and centroids based on the mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to the statistical uncertainties in their positions (typically {\~{}}50-150 kpc). Approximately 30{\%} of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiple bright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles that are not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems. We find halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by 5-30{\%} if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is not addressed.},

abstract = {Using a large N-body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation, we study the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc){\^{}}3 in a LCDM universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 1.1x10{\^{}}12 Msun, including 18 massive clusters with M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun. It also contains 1 088 797 galaxies with mass M{\_}gal {\textgreater} 2x10{\^{}}9 Msun and luminosity L {\textgreater} 9.5x10{\^{}}5 Lsun. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then computed the fraction f{\_}BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio Dv/s, where Dv is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster, and s is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. f{\_}BNC increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M{\_}cl {\~{}} 10{\^{}}12 Msun) to 0.5 for high-mass ones (M{\_}cl {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun), with no dependence on cluster redshift. The values of Dv/s vary from 0 to 1.8. These results are consistent with previous observational studies, and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. Analysis of the merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation reveals that 16 of these clusters have experienced major mergers in the past. These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merger of smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed.},

abstract = {Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the 'cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5 megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the 'metal' and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.},

abstract = {We characterize the typical offset between the dark matter (DM) projected centre and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in 10 000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey clusters. To place constraints on the centre of DM, we use an automated strong lensing (SL) analysis, mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption that light traces mass. The cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power law, and the DM component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting a low-order two-dimensional polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole range of polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. We find that the offsets between the BCG and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the DM, $\Delta$, are distributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are well described by a log-normal distribution with ⟨{\textless}mo form="prefix"{\textgreater}log10($\Delta$ [h-1 Mpc ])⟩=-1.895-0.004+0.003 and $\sigma$ = 0.501 ± 0.004 (95 per cent confidence levels) or {\textless}log10($\Delta$ [arcsec]){\textgreater} = 0.564 ± 0.005 and $\sigma$ = 0.475 ± 0.007. Some of the offsets originate in prior misidentifications of the BCG or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm, whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ˜10 per cent of the clusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributing to higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. Our results constitute the first statistically significant high-resolution distributions of DM-to-BCG offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly show that there exists such a typical non-zero offset, in the probed catalogue. The offsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higher separations are generally found for higher z clusters in agreement with the hierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could potentially help characterize the merger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters in future studies. In addition, the effective DM centre we adopt here, namely the peak of the smoothed light distribution representing the DM, can constitute a natural and alternative definition of cluster centres for optically selected cluster catalogues.},

abstract = {We present a strong and weak gravitational lens model of the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403, constrained using spectroscopy from the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS) and Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data. We search for emission lines in known multiply imaged sources in the GLASS spectra, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts of 31 multiple images belonging to 16 distinct source galaxies. The GLASS spectra provide the first spectroscopic measurements for 6 of the source galaxies. The weak lensing signal is acquired from 884 galaxies in the F606W HFF image. By combining the weak lensing constraints with 15 multiple image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and 9 multiple image systems with photometric redshifts, we reconstruct the gravitational potential of the cluster on an adaptive grid. The resulting total mass density map is compared with a stellar mass density map obtained from the deep Spitzer Frontier Fields imaging data to study the relative distribution of stellar and total mass in the cluster. We find that the projected stellar mass to total mass ratio, {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}, varies considerably with the stellar surface mass density. The mean projected stellar mass to total mass ratio is {\$}\backslashlangle f{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}} \backslashrangle= 0.009 \backslashpm 0.003 {\$} (stat.), but with a systematic error as large as {\$}0.004-0.005{\$}, dominated by the choice of the IMF.

abstract = {We use a joint optical/X-ray analysis to constrain the geometry and history of the ongoing merging event in the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 (z=0.397). Our investigation of cluster substructure rests primarily on a combined strong- and weak-lensing mass reconstruction based on the deep, high-resolution images obtained for the Hubble Frontier Fields initiative. To reveal the system's dynamics, we complement this lensing analysis with a study of the intra-cluster gas using shallow Chandra data, and a three-dimensional model of the distribution and motions of cluster galaxies derived from over 100 spectroscopic redshifts. The multi-scale grid model obtained from our combined lensing analysis extends the high-precision strong-lensing mass reconstruction recently performed to cluster-centric distances of almost 1 Mpc. Our analysis detects the two well known mass concentrations in the cluster core. A pronounced offset between collisional and collisionless matter is only observed for the SW cluster component, while excellent alignment is found for the NE cluster. Both the lensing analysis and the distribution of cluster light strongly suggest the presence of a third massive structure, almost 2 arcmin SW of the cluster centre. Since no X-ray emission is detected in this region, we conclude that this structure is non-virialised and speculate that it might be part of a large-scale filament almost aligned with our line of sight. Combining all evidence from the distribution of dark and luminous matter, we propose two alternative scenarios for the trajectories of the components of MACSJ0416.1-2403. Upcoming deep X-ray observations that allow the detection of shock fronts, cold cores, and sloshing gas (all key diagnostics for studies of cluster collisions) will allow us to test, and distinguish between these two scenarios.},

abstract = {We present an overview of galaxy evolution across cosmic time in the Illustris Simulation. Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2*1820{\^{}}3 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc){\^{}}3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z=0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z=0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star-formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z=5 to z=0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in HST mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z=2 to their z=0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z=0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star-formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {We present a detailed strong lensing, weak lensing and X-ray analysis of Abell 2744 (z = 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known. It appears to have unleashed `dark', `ghost', `bullet' and `stripped' substructures, each {\~{}}10{\^{}}14 solar masses. The phenomenology is complex and will present a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband HST imaging, we identify 34 strongly-lensed images of 11 galaxies around the massive Southern `core'. Combining this with weak lensing data from HST, VLT and Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We also perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our analyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern substructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet Cluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas and lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent constraint on the self-interaction cross section of dark matter particles sigma/m {\textless}{\~{}} 3 $\backslash$pm 1 cm{\^{}}2 g{\^{}}-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark matter, and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances. Most curiously, the `ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the `dark' clump (primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced `ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of components with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by follow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a second `bullet' clump in the North and an extremely `stripped' clump to the West. The latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matter and X-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.},

abstract = {We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E0657-56, a cluster with a rare, high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, sigma/m{\textless}1 cm{\^{}}2/g, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm{\^{}}2/g interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate which involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.},

abstract = {When a dark matter halo moves through a background of dark matter particles, self-interactions can lead to both deceleration and evaporation of the halo and thus shift its centroid relative to the collisionless stars and galaxies. We study the magnitude and time evolution of this shift for two classes of dark matter self-interactions, viz. frequent self-interactions with low momentum transfer (e.g. due to long-range interactions) and rare self-interactions with high momentum transfer (e.g. contact interactions), and find important differences between the two cases. We find that neither effect can be strong enough to completely separate the dark matter halo from the galaxies, if we impose conservative bounds on the self-interaction cross-section. The majority of both populations remain bound to the same gravitational potential and the peaks of their distributions are therefore always coincident. Consequently any separation is mainly due to particles which are leaving the gravitational potential, so will be largest shortly after the collision but not observable in evolved systems. Nevertheless the fraction of collisions with high momentum transfer is an important characteristic of self-interactions, which can potentially be extracted from observational data and provide an important clue as to the nature of dark matter.},

For both FoF and SO halos, the effect of AGN feedback is that of suppressing the HMFs to a level even below that of Dark Matter simulations.

A decrease of the halo masses ratio with respect to the DM case induces the decrease of the HMF in the AGN simulation. The shallower inner density profiles of halos in the AGN simulation witnesses that mass reduction is induced by the sudden displacement of gas induced by thermal AGN feedback. We provide fitting functions to describe halo mass variations at different overdensities, which can recover the HMFs with a residual random scatter {\$}\backslashlt 5{\$} per cent for halo masses larger than {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} {\~{}}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing magnification is measured with a significance of 9.7$\sigma$ on a large sample of galaxy clusters in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). This survey covers ˜154 deg2 and contains over 18 000 cluster candidates at redshifts 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.9, detected using the 3D-Matched Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al. We fit composite-NFW models to the ensemble, accounting for cluster miscentring, source-lens redshift overlap, as well as nearby structure (the two-halo term), and recover mass estimates of the cluster dark matter haloes in range of ˜1013 M⊙ to 2 × 1014 M⊙. Cluster richness is measured for the entire sample, and we bin the clusters according to both richness and redshift. A mass-richness relation M200 = M0(N200/20)$\beta$ is fit to the measurements. For two different cluster miscentring models, we find consistent results for the normalization and slope, M0 = (2.3 ± 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, $\beta$ = 1.4 ± 0.1 and M0 = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, $\beta$ = 1.5 ± 0.1. We find that accounting for the full redshift distribution of lenses and sources is important, since any overlap can have an impact on mass estimates inferred from flux magnification.},

@article{Torrey2015,
abstract = {We present our methods for generating a catalog of 7,000 synthetic images and 40,000 integrated spectra of redshift z = 0 galaxies from the Illustris Simulation. The mock data products are produced by using stellar population synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (SED) to each star particle in the galaxies. The resulting synthetic images and integrated SEDs therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic data products it is possible to produce monochromatic or color-composite images, perform SED fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structural properties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, and composition of the image catalog that makes up the Illustris Simulation Obsevatory. As a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellar mass estimates by applying the SED fitting code FAST to the synthetic galaxy products, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellar masses from the simulation. We find from this idealized experiment that systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that can be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimum galaxy age restriction.},

abstract = {We have made mass maps of three strong-lensing clusters, Abell 3827, Abell 2218 and Abell 1689, in order to test for mass-light offsets. The technique used is GRALE, which enables lens reconstruction with minimal assumptions, and specifically with no information about the cluster light being given. In the first two of these clusters, we find local mass peaks in the central regions that are displaced from the nearby galaxies by a few to several kpc. These offsets {\{}$\backslash$em could$\backslash$/{\}} be due to line of sight structure unrelated to the clusters, but that is very unlikely, given the typical levels of chance line-of-sight coincidences in {\$}\backslashLambda CDM{\$} simulations --- for Abell 3827 and Abell 2218 the offsets appear to be intrinsic. In the case of Abell 1689, we see no significant offsets in the central region, but we do detect a possible line of sight structure: it appears only when sources at {\$}z\backslashga 3{\$} are used for reconstructing the mass. We discuss possible origins of the mass-galaxy offsets in Abell 3827 and Abell 2218: these include pure gravitational effects like dynamical friction, but also non-standard mechanisms like self-interacting dark-matter.},

abstract = {We characterise the typical offset between the Dark Matter (DM) projected centre and the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in 10,000 SDSS clusters. To place constraints on the centre of DM, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis, mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption that light traces mass. The cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law, and the DM component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting a low-order 2D polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole range of polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. We find that the offsets between the BCG and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the DM, $\backslash$Delta, are distributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are well described by a log-normal distribution with {\textless}log{\_}{\{}10{\}}($\backslash$Delta [h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc]){\textgreater}=-1.895{\^{}}{\{}+0.003{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.004{\}}, and $\backslash$sigma=0.501$\backslash$pm0.004 (95{\%} confidence levels), or {\textless}log{\_}{\{}10{\}}($\backslash$Delta [$\backslash$arcsec]){\textgreater}=0.564$\backslash$pm0.005, and $\backslash$sigma=0.475$\backslash$pm0.007. Some of the offsets originate in prior misidentifications of the BCG or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm, whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that {\~{}}10{\%} of the clusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributing to higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. Our results constitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions of DM-to-BCG offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly show that there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. The offsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higher separations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with the hierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise the merger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxies with redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formation rates than field populations remains an important problem. As most candidate processes ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations of the local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a range in halo mass and redshift, are needed. In this work, we present and test a rigorous, probabilistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based on precise photometric redshifts and X-ray-selected groups drawn from the COSMOS field. The groups have masses in the range 1013 {\textless}{\~{}} M 200c/M ⊙ {\textless}{\~{}} 1014 and span redshifts 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. We characterize our selection algorithm via tests on spectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the Very Large Telescope, and by applying our method to detailed mock catalogs. We find that our group member galaxy sample has a purity of 84{\%} and completeness of 92{\%} within 0.5{\{}R{\_}{\{}200c{\}}{\}}. We measure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on the quality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as well as future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. As a first application of our new group member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that member galaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixed stellar mass out to z {\~{}} 1, indicating a significant relationship between star formation and environment at group scales. We also address the suggestion that dusty star-forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannot explain the low power seen in recent Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements.},

We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution from both strong and weak gravitational lensing data. Multi-color, high-resolution HST ACS images allow detection of many more arc candidates than were previously known, especially around the subcluster. Using the known redshift of one of the multiply imaged systems, we determine the remaining source redshifts using the predictive power of the strong lens model. Combining this information with shape measurements of "weakly" lensed sources, we derive a high-resolution, absolutely-calibrated mass map, using no assumptions regarding the physical properties of the underlying cluster potential. This map provides the best available quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster. We also confirm the result from Clowe et al. (2004,2006a).},

We perform a combined weak and strong lensing analysis with wide-field BVRi'z' Subaru/Suprime-Cam observations and 16-band Hubble Space Telescope observations taken as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We find consistent weak distortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies, and combine these signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of the cluster and its surrounding large-scale structure out to 5 Mpc/h. We find consistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where these independent data overlap, {\textless}500 kpc/h. The two-dimensional weak-lensing map reveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. We model the lensing shear field with 9 halos, including the main cluster, corresponding to mass peaks detected above 2.5$\backslash$sigma{\_}$\backslash$kappa. The total mass of the cluster as determined by the different methods is M{\_}{\{}vir{\}}=(2.8$\backslash$pm0.4) $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun. Although this is the most massive cluster known at z{\textgreater}0.5, in terms of extreme value statistics we conclude that the mass of MACS J0717.5+3745 by itself is not in serious tension with LambdaCDM, representing only a {\~{}}2{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} departure above the maximum simulated halo mass at this redshift.},

abstract = {We develop a statistical method to measure the interaction cross-section of Dark Matter, exploiting the continuous minor merger events in which small substructures fall into galaxy clusters. We find that by taking the ratio of the distances between the galaxies and Dark Matter, and galaxies and gas in accreting sub-halos, we form a quantity that can be statistically averaged over a large sample of systems whilst removing any inherent line-of-sight projections. In order to interpret this ratio as a cross-section of Dark Matter we derive an analytical description of sub-halo infall which encompasses; the force of the main cluster potential, the drag on a gas sub-halo, a model for Dark Matter self-interactions and the resulting sub-halo drag, the force on the gas and galaxies due to the Dark Matter sub-halo potential, and finally the buoyancy on the gas and Dark Matter. We create mock observations from cosmological simulations of structure formation and find that collisionless Dark Matter becomes physically separated from X-ray gas by up to 20h{\^{}}-1 kpc. Adding realistic levels of noise, we are able to predict achievable constraints from observational data. Current archival data should be able to detect a difference in the dynamical behaviour of Dark Matter and standard model particles at 6 sigma, and measure the total interaction cross-section sigma/m with 68{\%} confidence limits of +/- 1cm2g{\^{}}-1. We note that this method is not restricted by the limited number of major merging events and is easily extended to large samples of clusters from future surveys which could potentially push statistical errors to 0.1cm{\^{}}2g{\^{}}-1.},

Since the member galaxies are expected to follow similar collisionless dynamics as the dark matter, the galaxy density profile should show such a feature as well. We examine the potential of current datasets to test this prediction by selecting cluster members for a sample of 56 low-redshift (0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.3) galaxy clusters, constructing their projected number density profiles, and fitting them with two profiles, one with a steep density jump and one without. Additionally, we investigate the presence of a jump using a non-parametric spline approach. We find that some of these clusters show strong evidence for a model with a density jump. We discuss avenues for further analysis of the density jump with future datasets.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters are an established and powerful test-bed for theories of both galaxy evolution and cosmology. Accurate interpretation of cluster observations often requires robust identification of the location of the centre. Using a statistical sample of clusters drawn from a suite of cosmological simulations in which we have explored a range of galaxy formation models, we investigate how the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable - stars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by the gravitational potential. We explore several measures of cluster centre: the minimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centre if the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centre of BCG; and the peak and centroid of X-ray luminosity. We find that the centre of BCG correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potential than the X-ray defined centres, while AGN feedback acts to significantly enhance the offset between the peak X-ray luminosity and minimum gravitational potential. These results highlight the importance of centre identification when interpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoretical predictions and observational data.},

abstract = {Direct evidence for the existence of dark matter and measurements of its interaction cross-section have been provided by the physical offset between dark matter and intra- cluster gas in merging systems like the Bullet Cluster. Although a smaller signal, this effect is more abundant in minor mergers where infalling substructure dark matter and gas are segregated. In such low-mass systems the gravitational lensing signal comes primarily from weak lensing. A fundamental step in determining such an offset in sub- structure is the ability to accurately measure the positions of dark matter sub-peaks. Using simulated Hubble Space Telescope observations, we make a first assessment of the precision and accuracy with which we can measure infalling groups using weak gravitational lensing. We demonstrate that using an existing and well-used mass re- construction algorithm can measure the positions of 1.5x1013 M substructures that have parent halos ten times more massive with a bias of less than 0.3 . In this regime, our analysis suggests the precision is sufficient to detect (at 3 {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} statistical significance) the expected mean offset between dark matter and baryonic gas in infalling groups from a sample of 50 massive clusters.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of mass measurements for clusters of galaxies using ASCA and ROSAT X-ray data and constraints from strong and weak gravitational lensing. Our results for a sample of 13 clusters provide a consistent description of the distribution of gravitating matter in these systems. For the 6 cooling-flow clusters in the sample, which are the more dynamically-relaxed systems, the X-ray and strong gravitational lensing mass measurements show excellent agreement. The core radii for the mass distributions are small, with a mean value of {\~{}} 50 {\$}h{\_}{\{}50{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} kpc.   For the non-cooling flow clusters, the masses determined from the strong lensing data exceed the X-ray values by factors of {\$}2-4{\$}. However, significant offsets between the X-ray and lensing centres are observed, indicating that the X-ray and strong-lensing data are probing different lines of sight through the clusters. These offsets, and the generally complex dynamical states of the clusters inferred from their X-ray morphologies, lensing data and galaxy distributions, suggest that the gravitational potentials in the central regions of the non-cooling flow systems are evolving rapidly, and that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium involved in the X-ray mass measurements is likely to have broken down. The discrepancies between the X-ray and strong lensing mass measurements may be reconciled if the dynamical activity has caused the X-ray analyses to overestimate the core radii of the dominant mass clumps in these clusters. On larger spatial scales, comparisons of the X-ray mass results with measurements from weak gravitational lensing show excellent agreement for both cooling-flow and non-cooling flow clusters.
