abstract = {Using a large N-body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation, we study the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc)\^{}3 in a LCDM universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M\_cl > 1.1x10\^{}12 Msun, including 18 massive clusters with M\_cl > 10\^{}14 Msun. It also contains 1 088 797 galaxies with mass M\_gal > 2x10\^{}9 Msun and luminosity L > 9.5x10\^{}5 Lsun. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then computed the fraction f\_BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio Dv/s, where Dv is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster, and s is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. f\_BNC increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M\_cl \~{} 10\^{}12 Msun) to 0.5 for high-mass ones (M\_cl > 10\^{}14 Msun), with no dependence on cluster redshift. The values of Dv/s vary from 0 to 1.8. These results are consistent with previous observational studies, and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. Analysis of the merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation reveals that 16 of these clusters have experienced major mergers in the past. These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merger of smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed.},

@article{Sifon2014,
abstract = {Torques acting on galaxies lead to physical alignments, but the resulting ellipticity correlations are difficult to predict. As they constitute a major contaminant for cosmic shear studies, it is important to constrain the intrinsic alignment signal observationally. We measure the alignments of satellite galaxies within 91 massive galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.55 and quantify their impact on the cosmic shear signal. We combine a sample of 38,146 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with high-quality data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We use phase-space information to select 15,524 cluster members, 13,966 of which have shape measurements, and measure three different types of alignment: the radial alignment of satellite galaxies towards the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the common orientations of satellite galaxies and BCGs, and the radial alignments of satellites with each other. Residual systematic effects are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties. We detect no galaxy alignment of any kind out to at least \$3r\_\{200\}\$. The signal is consistent with zero for both blue and red galaxies, bright and faint, and also for subsamples of clusters based on redshift, dynamical mass, and dynamical state. These conclusions are unchanged if we increase the sample with bright clusters members from the red sequence. We augment our constraints with those from the literature to estimate the importance of the intrinsic alignments of satellites compared to that of central galaxies, for which the alignments are described by the linear alignment model. We find that the additional contribution from satellites can be ignored for current cosmic shear surveys such as KiDS, and that the linear alignment model is accurate enough to model intrinsic alignments for these surveys.},

@article{Vogelsberger2014a,
abstract = {Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the 'cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5 megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the 'metal' and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.},
